Hi. My name is Parent 5. I have three kids, 17, 13 and nine, all boys.

My name is Parent 1, I have two boys, a 8-year-old and almost 3-year-old. I think the most recent show that I personally watched with no children around was Schitt's Creek, which was amazing and helped me get through all these difficult times lately. I was a little bit late to the party, I started watching it maybe a month or two ago, but I could not stop. Even if the work hours were late, I had to make sure I'll catch an episode before I go sleep. With the kids, well with the older kid, I think a few months ago we watched Floor Is Lava on Netflix, which was fun to watch as a family. Besides that, I think my son watches lots of Marvel type things with my husband, which I don't participate in.",negative

I've watched a couple of foreign things my friends have recommended, but I'd love to recommend a series, it's long but it's amazing, it's called Orphan Black. It's been around for a little while, it's produced by the BBC. It's sci-if and it's about cloning. It has five seasons. It's a real deep dive, but it's incredible and now it just won an Emmy. So I'll say Orphan Black, it's really great.",negative

I've been watching a few things, but most recently I've been binge watching 9-1-1, it's a drama about 911 operators and I guess the LAFD and LAPD, and all the things that they go through. I can't say why would I want to watch that, I don't know, especially during these times. I have no idea why I watch, but it's just interesting and I learn things from watching it.

My elementary school guy, he didn't have any homework on the computer at all. And my middle schooler had very little, like type this one thing or something like that.

Maybe once a week he would type, words of the week was one of the options I picked to do. That was his only interaction with computer. Of course he had devices to play on, and he would go to his father's house every other weekend and he would be more exposed there to computers. But still he was busy.

And of course we were able to control it, it was an item you had to earn and if you didn't do well then you don't get to play. So it was a tool we could use as incentive during the week. So now that's all out the window, it's all available right there all day long. And getting him away from the computer now is a project in itself every day.",positive
gaming_group,1,1,3,Okay. If you can walk me through a little bit how your use of technology changed through the pandemic when they had to start using it more for school or what your situation was for your child.,1,"I can say for my eight-year-old, because again, we went from not really knowing how to use a computer or how to type, to transition really smoothly, I mean if you can call that a benefit, we transitioned really quickly. He was typing away, quickly was able to navigate where to go to sign into a Google classroom. So, that was impressive in the beginning, how quickly they were able to adapt to that. So yes... I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?",negative
gaming_group,1,1,3,Okay. If you can walk me through a little bit how your use of technology changed through the pandemic when they had to start using it more for school or what your situation was for your child.,1,"Right, exactly, it seems beneficial because it is an important part of your life as you grow older in high school clearly, and in middle school as Parent 4 said, there's some use of computer. So at first it seemed like a good thing, and I'm sure it is a good thing, it's just, like I said, it's just become overwhelming use of technology because they sit in front of it all day. And another thing, this use of YouTube, because I understand teachers post some things that you can look up on YouTube, so you can't block YouTube because it'll be used as a tool for one of those classes they have.",negative
gaming_group,1,1,3,Okay.

I can't even begin, it's just so bad. And transition from looking at your Google classroom or your Google meet and here's YouTube, it's just so easy. And we were not always there, we still have jobs and other things to do, can't just sit on top of them.

And then everybody needed a device, all of a sudden everybody needed a device Needed to be on at basically the same times so we got one device from school, we bought a laptop, we found an old laptop. It was like the gathering of devices. And then teaching... My nine-year-old, teaching him how to use it, he really hadn't used computers in that way. And so teaching him how to use it. My middle son is prone to migraines and so being on the screen caused migraines and so that caused some aversion because he didn't want to be on.",negative

If you can walk me through a little bit how your use of technology changed through the pandemic when they had to start using it more for school or what your situation was for your child.,5,"The schedules were kind of crazy, like all over the place. And the truth is that it's hard because my 17-year-old, who knew how to do all these things just kind of stayed in his room for months. And it was just... I feel bad saying it, but he was kind of left to his own devices. He wasn't a big social media guy, he has no social media still, but when the only way to communicate with his peers became to use... What is it? Discord, and all these other things, that became the only way to communicate with people. And then it almost, I feel like...

Because we have some special needs in our family, my schedule is really tight with my kids and so the little guys we go to bed at 8:30 and then 9:00 and then the older one was in bed by 10:00 and there was a lot of structure, and literally it was like a bomb hit it. People were going to bed at 1:00 in the morning, it was just totally... It felt chaotic and out of control, and it felt like the technology sputtered for a little bit as we gt devices figured out how to get everybody on and then it was this black hole that sucked you in.

gaming_group,1,1,3,Okay. If you can walk me through a little bit how your use of technology changed through the pandemic when they had to start using it more for school or what your situation was for your child.,3,"Sure, when lock down happened my then first grader, the school did a great job pivoting to remote quite quickly. They used seesaw as a platform. I did get two laptops from the DOE because we have a lot of tech but it's all very old and kind of fragile and I'm like, they're going to wreck it all. Nothings insured. We're self-employed and I could just see the whole business being wiped out so we did take a DOE iPads which was a lifesaver. But also, again, we got to one point where the computer teacher did that YouTube... We were not on the YouTube and she sent one link and they figured out, ""Oh, I can get to YouTube from this link.""",negative
gaming_group,1,1,3,Okay.

I was trying to figure out how to block... I was on the phone with the DOE, I was on the phone with a parent coordinator, I was calling the principal, like, ""How can I block YouTube without..."" I was putting timer things, it was driving me crazy, and it was downhill from there. I finally figured out my son, by banging on it so much he's actually broken the screen so whatever controls I put in, he could bang on it and it would just do whatever he wanted. A month later I exchange the iPad but I nearly ripped my own hair out over this YouTube. Yeah, the addiction sunk in over those first five months of lockdown of screens and YouTube and just that misery sucking.",negative
gaming_group,1,1,3,Okay. If you can walk me through a little bit how your use of technology changed through the pandemic when they had to start using it more for school or what your situation was for your child.,4,"Like I said, both my kids are on it all day. They're fully remote, both of them. Neither one of them has a full schedule so I hear my son... Because my desk is right next to his room, and I'm hearing him at like 10:00 in the morning, profanities on a game with his friend. And I'm like, I don't understand, it's a school day. Well, they don't have school, it's in between a break. So it's definitely made our day... Especially since I'm working right next to him, very difficult to try and do my job and be next to him. But it's their lives, they're in their rooms, if it's not school then it's playing games. My son plays a lot of games with his friends, my daughter doesn't but then she'll be on the YouTube also a lot, TickTock, whatever, and I kind of don't see them a lot during the day. Thankfully they do okay so I don't ask... I used to be a more involved and now I'm not really involved. Now it's a free for all.",negative

gaming_group,1,1,4,Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?,4,"Absolutely. If you want, I can finish that. Actually I'm having problems now because my sons school said... We requested, they didn't say it, but depending on the size of the class you might be able to go in one more day. You can only go one day a week now. And I was able to get him in two days. And the fit that I got, screaming at me for five days until that day came, it was horrible. About how [inaudible 00:33:53] the worst, making him go in for two days instead of just one, so I can only imagine what's going to happen next year.",positive
gaming_group,1,1,4,Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?,2,"I'm sorry. My sons, they actually go to school five days out of the week. Initially we were blended and I had the same issues, the same issues with just constantly on YouTube, and constantly playing Roblox. When they were supposed to do their work I would go in and I would see them clicking out of the YouTube window. We received two laptops from the DOE as well, but before it was kind of limited because we had a desktop and we had a laptop. So before they had to take turns going on the computer if they were allowed to. They went on the computer but it was mainly on the weekends because they did play Roblox but not as often.",negative
gaming_group,1,1,4,Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?,2,"But after everything shut down I didn't have much entertainment to do besides television or talking with your friends or Roblox or Discord or whatever. Yeah, it just consumed a lot of their time. My daughter, who is three, I couldn't send her to the babysitter anymore, so she was home with me while I was working from home so I would have to force her to look at YouTube too, or watch the television. So I kind of really felt bad because I had to do that so I try to always turn on something educational, like Sesame Street. But then she started telling me what she wanted to watch after a while, Nick Jr. or Netflix, so that became a problem.",positive
gaming_group,1,1,4,Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?,2,"But even after my son started going back to school five days out of the week it still became a problem, technology, because right after they do their homework they will go on YouTube or they go on Roblox or something. I don't know what they're doing in the back. I have to tell them to go in the back because when they come home from school I still have to work so it still became a problem even though they're back in school five days out of the week. So yeah, and they still have some assignments on the computer, like homework assignments on the computer. Yeah, even if they go back to school I feel like it still would be a problem if you're having issues now with them remotely. So yeah, that's my experience.",negative
gaming_group,1,1,4,Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?,5,"For me, the months that I tried to work from home with my three kids was nearly impossible, like I'm sure many other people. So out of desperation, in September we decided to put my middle schooler in a private school, so he has been going five days a week with some interruptions when they close school, but there hasn't been that many. Today, I guess I got word from the elementary school that they're moving to a five day week model, I guess in two weeks. But my son has been going for two days a week since October with the school closings and stuff. But he is happy to go. He's looking forward to go. And my high schooler has also been going blended, it's interesting because sometimes...",negative
gaming_group,1,1,4,Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?,5,"And my high schooler, I think it's interesting because even if he's the only one, which has happened several times, he goes when he supposed to go. I was like, ""You're going to keep going?"" And he's like, ""Yeah, I'm going to go."" And I'm like, ""Okay."" So I personally don't anticipate any issues. He's graduating, I think that's also part of it, because I think they missed out on their whole senior year and everything that they were looking forward to so just being able to go and see teachers and stuff like that, he I think wants that connection with people. So when he supposed to go, which is kind of like one day a week, maybe sometimes two days a week, they have this weird schedule that I still can't figure out, he's been going, he goes. So with my kids, they have bought into going back to school.",negative
gaming_group,1,1,5,Anything else anyone is anticipating about the transition back to going in person?,4,"My son has been on a 2-3 day week model since January. Before that it was 1-2 days a week I think. But between all the quarantines and the school closures because of those two case rules that they had we were in quarantine all the time until... Hopefully going forward it will be better, but we were in school barely, mostly all remote because of all that. But we've gone a few times for sure. My son, he's on the spectrum so he has all these social/emotional issues that usually prevent him from being able to get along with children. All prior to the school year... We did start a new school this year, so in September we went to a new school that we've attended this year, which was a group of 7-8 kids, when he was in person because of the cohorts. So maybe that has to do with an overall positive experience for him on the days that he did go in person, compared to the prior years when he was one of 32 with all these issues that he had that we didn't even address until this year.",negative
gaming_group,1,1,5,Anything else anyone is anticipating about the transition back to going in person?,4,"And as a matter fact we just actually got placed in the NES program so hopefully next year he will... Even though it was a difficult decision to make because we just started a new school this year, new school next year, but I understand it would benefit him and sort of tailored to the exact issues that he has. But in terms of him going back in person, it has been an overall positive experience, he is not protesting or anything. He was able to even make some friends even though they're social distancing with masks on and everything. So I was surprised and happy about that.",negative
gaming_group,1,1,5,Anything else anyone is anticipating about the transition back to going in person?,4,"Hopefully that will continue, but again, he will go to this program in September, he'll be in a smaller class size. Because I think the 32 kids that we've always had was overwhelming for him and he couldn't get along with anyone and it was just daily calls from school and nobody really ever addressed the issues that he had. It was always just like, he's that kid, type of thing. All the tears that were cried by me. So yeah, so I think... He actually even said the other day, ""Oh yes, I'm going..."" Because I remind him advance to prepare him that tomorrow is in person. He said, ""Oh yeah, I'll have something else to do than to play Roblox.",negative
gaming_group,1,1,5,Anything else anyone is anticipating about the transition back to going in person?,4,"Exactly. So I think this is actually one of the silver linings for me with the pandemic, is kids that have issues, sort of like some of our children, when there's a big class size and one teacher and all that, they may not have a good experience I may not want to go back there. But so far, in our case, I think due to the smaller class size, due to having a little more, I guess, personal attention from the teacher who is able to expand herself for the seven kids, it was overall good. It was actually better than the years before.",negative
gaming_group,1,1,6,"Interesting. So I'm just going to move on to a different question before we focus more on gaming. So as we're going back to school I'm just curious to hear from people, are there any aspects of the changes in the use of technology that you would like to see continue as we go back? Any positive parts you would like to see continue, or are there parts that you're really hoping would end as we go back?",3,"The Google Classrooms, since my daughter has very little executive functioning, she has social anxiety and ADHD, just being able to use the chat function since she'll never raise her hand and she'll never ask for help. Using Google Classroom to directly reach out to the teacher and use the chat function has been fantastic. And then when she goes in blended she has more direct contact with the teacher. She goes in twice or three times a week with her cohort. So I like the Google Classroom set up for her as a sixth grader. Also, the smaller cohorts have been great. It's going to be, just to answer the other question, odd when it goes back to 32 kids. But I love that she can send a quick message, she gets a quick response back, and so that communication has really helped her a lot as an introvert and having those issues.",negative

It's probably recent, in the past month or two maybe, that we get a daily update at the end of the day for my middle schooler. I at least see what he's doing, which is probably more than what I ever got from him or the school, definitely from the school, before. So, that's nice to at least get a daily rundown of... It might only be a sentence or two each, but it's at least Something. So, that's nice. And I also like that they do get immediate responses basically from teachers if they have questions on homework or questions... Whatever it might be, but everyone is pretty receptive to responding in a quick time period.",negative

He would not participate. He did not reach out in the G chat message or whatever. So that part has not been working out for us very well. However, someone had an idea that I overheard, and so I found a tutor, just another teacher from another school who does tutoring. And so the ability to have tutoring at your fingertips without having to commute or travel, or go and wait and sit there in the car has been...

So that's been amazing. So the feedback that I get from his two tutors that he has... And we haven't been doing it for a long time, maybe a month or so, maybe over a month, has been been great. Overall very positive. So I'm very happy because he did need help in ELA and math and was complete lack of participation in his Google Classroom. I didn't even know what he knew and what he learned any more this past year. So the one on one ability without having to go anywhere, get dressed, drive, so that was a great deal and I hope that will stay. And I hope it will stay because, why not? There's a demand and there's a supply, I think that would be one good takeaway, some remote learning options.",positive

It's not necessarily positive, it's kind of contradictory, but I don't even tell him to get off anymore. It used to be a fight because I used to have to tell him to get off, now we don't... So the fighting has actually gone down. The flip side of that is he's just on so much more. The language has got worse on the game and I'm constantly having to stop it. But he also has gotten a little closer with some of his friends that he can't see anymore because they're online talking.

Because my parents live in Connecticut, so I moved the middle child, the first-grader, Parent 2, Child 2, to a school in Connecticut. They're full-time. It is amazing. If they do close, which is very rarely, they do live synchronous learning so I don't have to be their teacher, I don't have to step away from my work day. The teacher actually answers questions. My little guy's two, so he is in pretend school/daycare. 
	But Parent 2, Child 1, her school, she's still virtual for her school in Manhattan. They actually are back full-time, every grade now except for the pre-K, but I chose... She had been hybrid, and I chose to mover her to all virtual when they decided to go back full-time. The reason I did that was because of the six-foot rule, and even if it was the three-foot rule, which the UFT hasn't adopted yet, the entire second grade is in the cafeteria. So my dyslexic, ADHD kid, which is just the tip of the iceberg of her issues, is supposed to be in a cafeteria with every single second grader, no partitions, teachers using microphones, the specials are all still via computer. 
	So whereas, Parent 2, Child 2 in Connecticut is getting live special... She gets to go on a real playground all day, she has a first best friend, a second best friend, a third best friend. And Parent 2, Child 1 just would get to go sit six feet apart from a kid and have a teacher use a microphone while three other teachers are using microphones. It was just ridiculous. And with her issues and being further behind, we just figured... And she's not doing school at home obviously, but we're hiring tutors. So we're educating her, not our school currently. 
	I have said this morning I'm actually trying to get Parent 2, Child 1 into a private school for next year, so soon I'll be taking this call on the road because they called me this morning that they want her in for a math evaluation this afternoon. So it's really frustrating.

I feel like so many kids are going to be such hot messes with various issues, maybe ADHD, maybe they're super behind in writing now or [crosstalk 00:25:52] issues and they're struggling.

But I mean, how can these teachers deal with this? Especially some of the schools that are really big with only one teacher that don't even have TAs and that sort of help. My kid's always been in an ICT classroom with two teachers, but in general those classes have been very big. There are still usually at least 27 kids and half of them have an IEP, and I would imagine that if my kid with her IEP is struggling, she's probably not the only one.

It's pretty similar to what you guys are saying. My son is the oldest, he's 12, so he didn't really use technology much in school. He's ADHD, as well as dyslexic. So purposefully, they avoided technology just for the process of writing is better. So he did use some apps for reading, like Learning Ally for reading and stuff. But basically, one positive thing is he's definitely learned how to type, which is amazing. At first I would watch him. It was so tedious. It was painful. For him, some parts would have been positive, like learning to type, it actually helped him be a little more organized because all of his work was in Google Classroom instead of forgetting papers at school. And so, he would get a notification from his teacher that he had work to do, and it would be right there.
	It wasn't something that he'd written and forgotten about or whatever. So in a lot of ways, it sort of helped him be a little more accountable because it was just in his face. I could look at it and see and help him. I don't know if he says he didn't have something, I could see that he did and it wasn't just something that he forgot he had, right? The negatives are definitely what you're saying, as far as being distracted and like... It was hopeless. I tried so hard in the beginning to keep him off of video games. But for him, it was a total distraction, but somehow he was able to manage to keep up with schoolwork. I don't know how he did it, but he definitely did his schoolwork, in addition to watching videos while the teacher was talking, which makes no sense.
	It would drive me batty, but the same thing. I'm trying to work and I can't stay on top of him. I tried all the screen time things, but then he would just find ways around it. The greatest one was figuring out that he had to have Google Docs. So he figured out how he could import his YouTube videos into Google Doc and watch them, even though I turned off YouTube. One day, I'm like, ""How is he watching that?"" And he even told me, he was like, ""Oh!"" Like he was so proud, but I was like, ""That's great that you figured it out, but it's-"" [crosstalk 00:25:52]",negative

But it was a little more manageable because we could draw the line. He didn't need the computer or the iPad to do something, so we could take it away. But like you're saying, the school, it's how he socialized, how he did all of his schoolwork. So it was a little hard to sort of... But part of me realizes it's his personality. So, in general, it's something that we have to work on anyway because there's always going to be the temptation of electronic. I mean, as adults, we still have to learn how to turn off all the other distractions and do our work, so.",positive

So in a lot of ways, they changed some of their strategies to make things a little more interactive instead of a little less, sort of cut and dry, so they can engage them more, which helped somewhat, but.
	Anyways, so my daughter, I don't know, she's totally addicted to her device, which she didn't... Well, we had a family iPad before, but then once this happened, she's 10, almost 11. So we eventually... She has her own device so that she could do the school stuff and she's addicted to it. But it's been a little tricky for her because she's definitely become... It's hard to motivate her to do other things because it's like... So the gratification is there. It's so easy. I don't know.

	So, okay. So moving on to the next question, which is, as we have already started going back to school or planning to return to school, what challenges do you anticipate for your children returning to school? And are there any parts that you would maybe want to see continue or things that you would definitely want to see disappear? So anyone can take that one first.",1,"Well, since I'm already muting, I think that going forward, it's never, it's not going to ever be the same the way it was. We're in for the whole new life, basically. And I think that I'm not ever going to get my iPad back. That's gone, so that's a bummer. And I think that I'm going to see what I saw at the very end of the year when they went back. And I think I'm going to see that in the fall, meaning towards the end of the year, my son was failing out of school. And it was because I don't think anybody was monitoring him. At least when he was home, I was monitoring him a little bit. Enough to be like, ""Did you do this? Did you do that?""
	Well, I'm not a helicopter parent anyway, but I'm certainly not... I'm thinking that he's got special ed teachers who keep him on track and make them write down what he needs to do at the end of every day. But I found out that he was missing entire homeworks, entire reports, and when I would ask him, he would, ""Oh yeah, no, I turned everything in. Everything's totally fine."" And then I get an email from the school saying, ""He's got an F,"" Or ""He's got a D."" He's missing these six things. And so I anticipate it's going to be very similar to that.
	As Parent 2 mentioned with the dyslexia, my son also has dyslexia. He was just diagnosed, though. And it's not the one where you flip the things. It's a much more weird. I don't know. Anyways, he's doing the Wilson book programs. And so, and he has summer school because of it, because and he's only on grade three, it's really bad. And so, I mean, the guy can barely read, and even when he reads, he can't comprehend. So I just feel like I'm already starting off with just a huge catch-up that is unrealistic. He's not going to catch up. And so it's going to take years to get there. And it's going to take a lot of summer school, so.
	I mean, and I think that I actually anticipate that he's going to need outside help and not just tutors, but people who are specifically trained in where he has deficiencies, with the ADHD and the focusing and the reading comprehension, and really, because he has to unlearn the way he learned and then relearn it a different way with the Wilson, that I think that I'm just anticipating a shit show",negative

So I don't know, I think that there were some good things, like with the Google classroom and stuff, I could, not that I did, but because he gets very upset if I try to stay on top of him. He was able to see what he was missing and everything. And so I think going back, I think that he has learned some executive skills that he didn't have before, which is really good for somebody who's 16 and theoretically will fly the coop in two years. I do think he has expressed the fact that he is looking forward to going back to school. Because he will not be allowed to play video games while he's supposed to be listening to the teachers, so that's a good thing. I do agree that he has not learned as much as he should have. And I think that the thing that I'm most worried about is his math because he's supposed to go into pre-calculus next year, and I'm not sure he knows trigonometry or whatever he was supposed to learn this year. But we'll deal with it, tutors, whatever if he gets into trouble.
	I'm not sure that I would agree with leaving everybody back because I do think... For my daughter, she's much more high functioning than my son. And she had a 99 average between her classes and went to school and got all her schoolwork done and never handed anything in late. And meanwhile, my son had 20 missing assignments the day before school ended, and somehow he got it down to six. So, I think my daughter, I think she actually benefited because she's a seventh-grade girl and seventh-grade girls are so mean to each other and the fact that they were at home and did not have to interact with all the other mean girls. I think that was actually good for her. So-",negative

I mean, my son was, I guess, I don't know how much, whatever's on, confidential. But the day before COVID hit, he was suspended for substance abuse in the school. And then he didn't have to do his suspension. Because they were like, ""No, don't come in."" Because I'm a health care worker, and they're like, ""No, no, she's been exposed to COVID."" So COVID was amazing because he was not allowed to interact with anybody for the first six months. And so he sort of was forced to deal with the substance abuse stuff and didn't have access to it and all that, so that [crosstalk 00:37:34] was good.

gaming_group,1,3,3,"Yeah, I was. And this is a question for everybody. We've heard a lot of parents talk about the pros and cons of the ways in which their children's teachers have managed their kid's specific needs, how Google classroom plays a role. How discord, how these other online resources affect that. So I just wanted to know, from you guys' perspective, how your specific teachers have either contributed or aided in the problems that your kids have dealt with throughout the pandemic and online technology in-school use and things like that.",2,"One thing I would say sort of to add to both of these things is my daughter's 10, and she's in fifth grade. So one negative thing that I saw that her teacher actually helped with a little was I think it was a lot for them to have to stare at themselves on the screen all the time. My daughter started, I don't know, worrying about things about herself, like ""My eyebrows are too... You can't see my..."", all these crazy things. And it's because she's looking at all of her friends and herself straight on all the time. So it did become sort of a conversation with her teacher. And they were pretty strict at first about trying to get them to turn all their cameras on.
	But I think they became a little more lenient when they sort of realized that kids can have their camera off but still be paying attention, which is the case with my daughter, probably not my son. But my daughter definitely, she would be doing what she needed to do most of the time. But so I do think it kind of, I don't know, it was this weird... She became a little more self-conscious, I think, I don't know.
	But then it was interesting also to see the difference between my daughter's teachers and my son's teachers. He had way more daily, all the time classes in-person on Zoom. Whereas my daughter was a little more... She did have in-person, but it was, I don't know, half the amount of time as him probably. So I don't know. She had to work more independently than he did. I don't know.",positive

So I think that the teachers... It really depended on the type of teacher. The general ed teachers, I found, were less tolerant of any adjustments to the technology or to the timeframes of things. And they were just less flexible. And I think it's because they were just overwhelmed with so many kids, plus so many kids with technology issues. And my boys didn't have the same experience because I don't have a girl. But I really, if I had been her, I would have been like, ""Oh my God, oh my God."" I would have been like, ""Whoa, this is not good. Everybody's seeing me."" I would have flipped, so. But my kids are like, ""I have to shower, what?"" So I think that the general ed teachers were... I found some of them to be mean and just intolerant to any adjustments.
	And, but then the special ed teachers would come in and say, ""Okay, let's deal with this."" And much the way they do at the actual school in-person. And so, I felt that they really helped facilitate the situation. And also act as a go-between in between me, the general ed teacher, and [inaudible 00:42:49] and my kids, both of them really. And so, I think that because they had two teachers, that really helped a lot. But also, I would find they would just disappear. We would log into school, and they would be like, ""So-and-so is out."" Okay. And they would be out for one day. ""So here's an assignment. We're not going to give you any instructions."" Or ""We don't have a teacher for you because we don't have subs. So go do it.""
	And that was very hard for them to understand that. And then you had also the ones who were like, ""Well, I'm out for whatever,"" or ""I'm sick."" A lot of them did get sick, so they were out for a month. And so, in that case, if they had two teachers, the other one picked up the slack. But it was mostly just one day here, one day there, where it wasn't anticipated. And so the kids were just sort of left hanging. And it was tough because they were like, ""Well, how do we do attendance if she's not there? Or he's not there?"" And it was just, Anyway, I think the teachers were frustrated, and that showed, that came through very much so. And honestly, they should have been frustrated. It was frustrating for everybody. So, that's it.",negative

So, there was definitely a wide range of responses. Some teachers handled things really well. And I have to say that at my son's school, they were very lenient about handing in assignments late. And my daughter's school. They were also trying to focus on sort of the kids who were not handing in assignments, which I thought was really nice of them.
	So, but there were definitely, there were some teachers who showed up every day and wanted the cameras on. I mean, I guess they all showed up every day, but there was definitely some people who allowed the kids... Like Parent 4, Child 1 would, sorry, my son would lay in bed for his first, for the morning of classes. And some of the teachers were like, ""Fine. He's in bed."" But some of the teachers were like, ""No, he has to sit up, and we have to see him sit up."" Because he would fall back to sleep during some of the classes, so. But I think the teachers were all... But my kids go to these really progressive schools in the city. So I think that that had something to do with the fact that the teachers were very lenient and forgiving of all the craziness that was happening.",negative

Right now, it's hard to get my kids to... I don't know. They feel like they've become hermits in some ways. So it is hard for me to get them to think outside of their video game box. You could give them a list of things to do and they can't. I don't know, they don't seem to want to do anything, so I think that's going to be the challenge.

Do you have anything to say about any challenges you're anticipating in going back and returning to being fully in-person?",1,"I'll go. I think, first of all, we need to remember that it's not the '80s, and we're in a totally different era with or without COVID. I think that they are online all the time. And talk to adults who are young, much younger than us, but still in their 20s and things. And that's how they live. They're constantly online, be it for work and for gaming. And in some cases, I think that's just going to be the new norm, and it's not all bad because some gaming will teach you strategy and it's conflict resolution and all sorts of things. I mean, you can go one way or the other. In terms of the gaming, though. I think that I'm seeing that my youngest, my eight-year-old is much more addicted than he ever was.
	Before. Yes, he had my iPad. Yes, but I could easily take it away from him. Now, it's almost like the Chromebooks became a gateway drug to this whole, like a video game addiction thing. And both of my kids are complete addicts, complete. If I take it away from them, they will go through absolute withdrawals, to the point where I'm like, ""Whoa, this is not an appropriate reaction to what's going on."" And the world is ending apparently, if I turn off the internet, so. And so I think that because it's sort of the Chromebooks came in and they figured out how to use them, and the teachers taught them how to use them. Now they've got all these skills that they can use for good or evil. And so they're using it for both.
	And I do find my eight-year-old, who would never lie and sneak, sneaks the iPad, sneaks the video games. He still admits to it, but soon, he will not admit to it. And he will not say, ""Oh mom, last night I woke up, and I played the video."" At some point, he's going to start lying. My other one is I actually have to cut him off at the knees. I have to say, ""Everything's being shut down in 10 minutes."" Otherwise, he will be up until 3:00 AM, every single night playing, playing, playing. And so are all of his friends. That's what I don't understand. I'm like, ""Who are you playing with?"" And he's like, ""All of my friends."" And so they're all. I don't know what's going on, but everybody is just constantly on video games.
	And that's how they interact socially. And we're not into play dates yet anymore, or them getting together socially outside yet. Maybe it's because everybody tends to have younger kids. So they don't want to expose those who are vaccinated. I mean, those who are not vaccinated to anything, which I totally get. And so they still need that for socialization. So I'm stuck, I'm stuck between both. And I think it's just going to get worse, and I think we just need to embrace it and try and figure out what they're really getting out of it in a positive way and emphasize that.
	And so, and I think there are a lot... I can't think of all of them now, but I read an article that was just really, it was pro-gaming, and it was awesome. Because I was like, ""Oh, I never thought of that."" The strategy and conflict resolution. And they had brothers who lived... Were really close, and then they moved far away from each other. But the one thing they had in common was video games, and they talk every day. That's a good thing. And so I think there's a lot of positives that people forget about.

It's almost like... It's not like drugs, cigarettes, or something like that, it's like sugar or caffeine. You can't avoid sugar. You have to have a little bit of it, but you got to be able to control it. So, we could look at it like, sugar can be a good thing, sometimes it makes things taste good, but there has to be a balance and a way of figuring that out.

Like they know, and then, I mean, they will ask for me to turn it back on or whatever, but it's like, I don't know. Because if it were up to me, I would forget, and it would be much later. So, that kind of helps a lot. The thing with my kids are, the different things they're doing, lots of things are positive, Minecraft, all those things, but the most annoying thing are the YouTube videos of craziness that just keep going and going. It's just such a mind numbing time-suck that my daughter gets into.

I think one thing that I actually wanted to say that I didn't bring up before about the social thing, my son actually had a girlfriend all from COVID. So, they've been together for the past 17 months or something. And for a while, they were like their own pod, and he went to her lake house and she would spend time with us. And now that things are opening up, he wants to spend time with his friends and she wants to spend time with her friends. And so, they're having these issues that they haven't had for the past 17 months with things that girlfriends and boyfriends probably should have learned how to navigate by this point in their relationship.

Like when I needed to get something done, like make dinner, or something, and I just needed them occupied, that was it.
	I mean, some of that context, I think, matters, because I'm a single parent and we lived in an apartment in Brooklyn. So, the option of saying, ""Go outside and play,"" isn't there. If I have to be inside doing something, they have to be inside with me. And that's changed too, because we've moved since then.

They knew how to use them, but it was just an arbitrary thing, because they would use them in school and it was sufficient. 
	And so, obviously, during the pandemic, they had a steep learning curve, and they went from like 10% of knowledge to 200% of knowledge. I've tried blocking some apps from them and websites, and they actually figure out a way around. So, even though it's blocked, they can still somehow manage to get around it.

So, I think it's harder for him to relate to his peers and teachers, because they're just a face on the screen. 
	ADHD, I feel like has gotten worse, but dyslexia has gotten better. Not that it's gotten better, but he's able to manage it better, having those access to that technology. It's been sort of a trade off and, and we're still figuring out how to manage that. Because when he wants help, then he's like, it's hard to pull him away from the computer. So, he tends to be now overstimulated, dysregulated. 
	And so, we're talking about, that's great, he moved up three reading levels, but he's bouncing off the wall. So, how do you manage that?

	But he can't focus on live or asynchronous activities on the computer because of the other options available. I mean, I do think, in theory, if you had a single... Or you had some kind of computer device that the teacher controlled, that did not have any freedom for the student to change what you could look at, it could work, maybe, but it doesn't.

But he also would get up and walk away in the middle of things. He had no problem lying to me. He'd tell me, ""Oh yeah, class is done. I signed out of the meeting because it was over."" 
	In one school, they had a pair of call to try to work with him one-on-one on the phone. Which was terrible because she had a cell phone with a bad connection, so it was difficult, but he would hang up on her constantly. It was so rude, but she would call me and say, ""He hung up on me.""
	And then the second school, they did nothing, absolutely nothing to take his IEP and translate it to online. They just said, ""We can't. There's nothing we can do."" And it's been extremely frustrating. So, he's falling behind, way behind, in terms of where he was. I don't know that he's lost learning, but he hasn't been making progress. And it is, he needs to be in-person.
	Now, they returned to in-person four days a week, but they have not stopped using those computers. They sit at their desk, six feet apart, and every activity is computer-based, except recess and lunch. Surprise, those are his favorite subjects now. I mean, I think there's a tendency that they always would be. So, maybe it's not the technology part. 
	And it is a shame, because the computer, a screen can be a great learning tool. Like Parent 4 was saying, at their old school, before the pandemic, the kindergarten has had a research project, which the parents helped out with. And I was one of them. The kids were going to get a fish tank, and each kid chose a fish they wanted to research. So, that's what I did. 
	I sat next to them at the computer and said, ""What's your fish?"" And we found a picture of it together on the computer, to print it out. And then we looked up information. Then they had to find out how big is the fish. And we cut a string, and then they click it over to the fish tank to see if it would fit in their fish tank. And that was an amazing use of the computer with adult assistance. And that's not what we're getting though, at this point. So, I'll stop.",negative

	Also, with burgeoning independence, he used to walk to school from our house in Brooklyn, like it's five blocks. But he'd go there and come home by himself, in eighth grade. And then this term, under the same roof with us 24/7, I mean, it's horrible. He's just started back two days and every other Friday a week. So, he's taking the subway to Astoria, to high school.

Now, terrible transition into middle school. Terrible. I mean, there's like six different teachers. She's got executive functioning. Disaster, with that.
	She's no longer organized. It's been a real challenge. We were able to... In September, they went back to school every other day. It was twice a week. And in March, we got her to start going to school every day, which has helped her get more into a routine. I have an IEP meeting set up for her on Friday, to gather extra help.
	I mean, it's still been a battle even with her back in school. She's not getting the extra attention that she needs. It just, it's been an awful transition. Maybe if your kid's just like... How do you say it? Is normal, doesn't have any extra needs, maybe it went okay. But I know for my daughter, it did not transition well.
	And I do want to say for one of my younger daughter, she's very anxious. She likes to stay close to me, always wants to know where I am, if I leave the house, where I'm going. So, being at home and doing school, she actually, she was my best one. She was not doing that great in school, but at home, she actually, she was on time for every meeting.

And, of course, what I did, because of the whole roadblocks and all the other issues, I put so many restrictions on that computer. I used a springtime from the Apple. I bought Custodio, for her phone.

Like I said, it's been a weird thing with dyslexia improving with some of the things he's managing, but all the other stuff is falling apart. So, if he were more attentive, I would send him to school. But he forgets, he loses his mask, puts his hand in his mouth. If he gets bored, he just starts jumping, rolling around. It's not feasible for me to send him in now, as much as I would love him to have that in-person experience.
	But yeah, I definitely agree that the computers must go, at least at home. I don't care what they do in school. They sometimes behave better in school. They're more compliant, when they come home, they want to relax. So, it's a little bit different.

I understood, in the sense that they didn't want me also messing up their machine, but if I can't keep my kid off inappropriate YouTube sites, then it's not an appropriate tool.
	However, I'm trying here to think about, how could you do it in a positive way? Because I feel obligated. Media studies is my thing. I'm not anti media studies, but I teach college students, I do not teach ignorance. There's a big difference. But I think some of the problems with the online reading programs and mass problems, for me, well, there's two things.
	One, I don't think the kids get real feedback. Yes, the game tells you if you got the question right or wrong, but I don't think it's the same effect as a person that you haven't had a relationship with, the teacher, expressing that, ""Wow, I've noticed that you've been improving."" Or, ""I noticed you're not doing as well today. Are you sleeping?"" Whatever it is, that kind of response feedback is really crucial, especially the younger they are, not just an instant little... The game fanfare and stuff is fine.
	But two is, as a parent, I have no idea what they're doing when it's online. You don't get a print here. It's not like getting the papers. And I got too much paper before this, then I would get home like, ""Oh my child wrote all these sentences."" Or, ""These are their math worksheets. I can see what they're doing, and what they're struggling with. I can see their handwriting improving."" I can't see anything. And the teachers on the report cards, they don't say much. Just, it's like, ""Meet standards. Approaching standards."" But what does that mean? I can't see the material. 
	I mean, unless I don't work and sit next to them all day and watch them doing it, which is incredibly boring on top of everything, on top of just not being possible. So, in theory, if there were some programs or a way of using that involved, both things, like some practice of the math online, but also some way of a parent viewing results quickly, like getting, I don't know, a weekly snapshot of like, ""What did your child do? How many problems did they miss? Does it look like they're walking away maybe because they're not doing any of it?"" I mean, different way to get contact.",positive

I'm just waiting for... Not to mention their phone. But it's been positive for him, even going in and having the onscreen class, because he's getting to know the building. It's a new high school, I mean, for him, and he has met some kids. So, just finding his way around the building is the thing, and meeting kids in the flesh. So, it's been a plus.",negative

So, every other day she had to be at the school, at 7:15, but on her home days, there was no live instruction. So, she could sleep till whenever. And she's getting to the point, like on the weekends, she loves to sleep later. She's going to bed the same time, I'd let her sleep in. That was hard. It's hard. It's been hard to get her up every day, to be on a schedule. But other than that, I'm very happy that they're back. Sorry.",negative

	I have one more question about the education piece, and then I want to just move in more into the gaming. Because I know I'm hearing a lot that gaming has been an issue for a bunch of you. 
	I know some of your kids are already back in school, but what challenges have you seen for returning to in-person school, or what challenges do you anticipate in returning to in-person school after whatever amount of time?",3,"I foresee that being an issue as well. Because, right now, they can wake up five minutes before their class. They can brush their teeth in between breaks, or between classes rather. Like they can eat in front of the screen. They don't have to worry so much about their outfit, and being comfortable. They can lay in bed when they're in class, it's fine.
	Once they start school, they can't do any of that. And my oldest actually expressed that to me. She said, ""I'm concerned."" Because she started sixth grade this year, and it's a new group of kids. So, she will not know anyone when she goes in for seventh grade in school, because we started talking about it. I said, ""Well, most likely you'll be going in, because you guys can't stay remote forever.""
	And she, herself expressed that, she said, ""I don't know if I would feel comfortable with the schedule, with the noise again, and people I don't know."" So, I foresee that being an issue. And the schedule, they'd have to get up earlier. They can't just leave the class because they're bored, or walk around with their laptop into a different room because they want to get comfortable. They got to sit at their desk all the time. It's a lot more rigid, there's limitations with that.
	But on the other hand, I think having that schedule and having that set routine will be helpful. It's just, I foresee the adjustment period being difficult. And from my youngest, he actually had a lot of anxiety going to school, because of all the issues he was having. He found school being completely overwhelming, and the noise, and the concentration, and the duration of classes was really horrible for him. We would deal with crying spells and meltdowns every single morning. 
	I'm not looking forward to that, and I anticipate that happening. But at the same time, being ADHD and ODD, being remote is not working for him. So, obviously, he would have to go back to school. Again, I may need some hardcore liquor just to get me through those mornings, because that used to be grueling for us every single morning. 
	So, for us, parting with the comfort and the informality, but at the same time, looking forward to in-person interactions, social interactions, because that's getting shunted right now. I feel like they're missing out on that and their development is sliding backwards. Because on the screen friends are not the same as in real life friends. ",negative
gaming_group,1,4,5,"	I'd like to hear from you a little bit about what was your kids' exposure or experience with gaming before the pandemic? Did you have concerns before the pandemic? Were there benefits before the pandemic? And how has that changed? And what are your concerns, or do you see benefits with gaming? Parent 4, you want to lead us off, because...",4,"Sure. Sure. Yeah. Well, for Parent 4, Child 2, of course, as I said, the seven-year-old, she just wasn't allowed to do it, so it didn't change. And right now, I don't think she really has the time or facilities to get involved in it, because I won't let her when I'm around, and then in school, people are monitoring. So, it's not an issue for her.
	For Parent 4, Child 1, she had started doing that, playing the games and all, but it was just because she didn't have full access to a computer all the time, except just when she was doing homework. It was just, ""Here's your time. Now your time's over. Now you're done."" I didn't really mind. I would have preferred it was something other than computer game, but if that's what she wanted to do, I didn't really have an issue with that. 
	But it's just that, now, it just seems like it's always available. And even, sometimes with certain restrictions, she could find a way around it. Instead of using Safari, which was restricted by the computer, she found a way to use Chrome, and I had to work around that. I called Apple and spent hours on the phone to try to figure out how to block that too. And so, it became a real struggle. 
	I think we've got it under control, but it just does seem that it's just much more focus on the screen. For us, I don't think it's so much that gaming has taken over, because I do have restrictions, but it's just the focus on the computer. And certainly in the time she has, she would go to that. And it's definitely become a social aspect at this point.
	It's like, ""Oh, can I have a come over?"" And then they want to sit and play computer games together. So, ""Dude, you just spent all day on the computer, you could have done that at a come over? She's finally in front of you and you're going to sit in front of the computer together?"" It's just crazy to me. So...",negative

And she's mentioned a couple other people, but I have always made it real... We've been very strong for the fact that, ""I don't want you be with people you don't know."" And as far as I know, she's been respectful of that. Maybe she doesn't let me know, but I think that she's pretty respectful of that. And it's, for her, it's more fun if there are people she already knows. She already has a relationship with them, so that makes it more interpersonal, somehow.",positive

Parent 4, you want to lead us off, because...",5,"It took me a minute to remember before. Well, I mean, one reason is, one of the things I study, and I'm teaching a class on video games now, it's complicated in my house because I am a video gamer. And I knew that, going, before I had kids, that this would be part of our lives. It doesn't mean that they can play whenever and whatever they want. 
	My kids played some games before the pandemic. I had a lot of control though, because they were not, at that point, technologically able to turn on or unlock any real game by themselves, completely by themselves. They could ask for it and I could give it to them or not. I think that they did have more TV access, typical stuff, but not so much with video games, but they did play. I liked that, but then again, I was curating the game, so I was comfortable with that.
	Now, it is, I think I'm still maintaining better control over games than just YouTube access. For me, YouTube is the thing that is everywhere and you can't block it out well enough. Also, it's just, an eight year old shouldn't be watching, 20 year olds, to eight hours a day, just, even if they're not swearing, or something. It's just things that he's learning, that he shouldn't be learning yet. 
	But he does come home, and that's what all he wants. He wants to play Minecraft, Minecraft, Minecraft. It's not a bad game, but he doesn't have any control. I can't set an hour long limit for him that he would respect. Like I said, I do set limits, but I have to be active in a way that's hard when I'm working full-time, and not getting... We're not out of the house enough, still, I guess, to make it easier, because he can't think of anything else to do. That's the real problem.
	If I take it away, I have to take it away for like a whole weekend and he'll start remembering, ""Oh yeah, I can think of, we can come up with these other games."" But as soon as they get a day of playing games, like I sleep in and they manage to turn it on, then it's just moping and, ""I can't play. I can't think of anything. I'm bored."" I guess it's a skill that they're going to have to learn though. The ability to respect limits, but also recognize, make choices.
	""I have this much gaming time, and I'm going to actively choose what I want to play."" He'll do something like, ""But I didn't get to do this thing I wanted to do."" I was like, ""Well, you should have done it before your time right now."" I don't know when an eight year old with ADHD is really going to develop that. I definitely had to give in for a while, when they were home all the time. I had to give into it just to get my work done. And that's what I didn't like about the pandemic stuff.",negative

Were there benefits before the pandemic? And how has that changed? And what are your concerns, or do you see benefits with gaming? Parent 4, you want to lead us off, because...",3,"One of my main concerns is, as mentioned before, by many of us, kids having access to games and being able to talk to people in the game, I don't know who these people are. They may not be who they say they are. And I've tried to talk to my kids about stranger danger and online safety. 
	But again, when they feel like they've connected with someone, it's hard for them to not... They could give away certain information without meaning to, or realizing to. And so, then they open themselves up and, potentially, the family up for whatever dangs there are. 
	I remember I have to constantly remind them, like, ""If someone's asking you how old you are, if you're a boy or a girl, it doesn't matter. You joke around with them, you don't have to be rude. You could say, 'I'm a dog, and I'm seven in dog years, or something.' Like, 'Well, I'm 40 in dog years.' Make it a joke. Say, 'I'm an alien. I'm a monster.' So they think that you're just goofing around.'''""
	I want them to understand that people may not what they are, but they have this image in their head, of who they're playing with. And it's hard, because we're talking about seven year olds and 60 year olds playing in the same platform. They're all different frames of mind, and different psychological stability, you know? So, I have that concern.
	It's been hard for me to explain it to the younger one. The older one seems to get it, but even so, there's still issues. That's been the biggest thing for me with the games. Aside all the horrible things, in terms of addiction, isolation, ignoring me when I ask for something, and having tantrums when I take it away, but the safety. And understanding that you have to keep in mind that you don't know who's on the other end. ",negative

So far, everything needed me to okay it. It would be great if they could play with their friends, and they let them play one game like that, which was among us.
	Because the chat time was so short that... It wasn't as bad as some of the others. But there are still problematic things that happened, because I played it, like friends that play, it is adults and children.
	And I tried to talk to them about the same thing. About, ""You shouldn't ever give out your age."" And like, ""But why?"" ""It doesn't matter."" I was like, ""Well, because sometimes people can use that information to locate children and kidnap them."" Was like, ""I wouldn't go with them."" 
	And I'm just like, ""Just stop giving away information about yourself."" That's one area I'm very hesitant to give them access to, but the pressure is mounting as more of their friends are doing it. And it is a social... I like the social part if it's all eight year olds, or something, but the mixed group thing was very difficult. ",negative
gaming_group,1,4,6,"Right. I guess last question... I feel like I know the answer to this, based on some of the things you said. And so, thinking about the changes that have happened in gaming use, is there anything with gaming that you would like to see continue as we return back to school? What do you hope for about gaming, as we go back?",3,"I mean, there's also positive things. Granted, I hate the darn thing. It's driving me mad. And yes, they are in it way too much. But it forced my son to start doing math, because when he's in Minecraft and he has to calculate his resources, even though he says he hates math, somehow, he's able to quickly pick up on how many more resources he needs, what he has, and how much of it he needs. It just becomes second nature to him.
	And I tried to explain to him before, when he said, ""I hate math. It's useless."" I said, ""But you use math in Minecraft."" He says, ""No, but that doesn't count, because that's fun."" You know? It has its positive aspect. Also, my husband is a gamer, and this gives them an opportunity to bond, and they can play the games together. Also, on the days when they can see their friends, they could play the games together among us. When they do a private game and they'll do it together, that's fine.
	If there could be some way to ensure that we're not having such different range of ages play, and we could ensure, in some way, the safety of them playing on, and maybe have more control in limitations, in terms of how much time they can spend on there, I don't mind it. Because, like I said, it has some uses. It forced him to read, also, because he has to read the instructions, you know? Whereas before, he would just walk away. It does, but if it's uncontrolled, unmonitored, it's just free for all, and definitely, yeah. That's my five cents out there.",negative

Just, I don't know why that one game, but my kids have a same-age cousin, who, they've always lived on opposite sides of the country. So they've met her a few times, but they've actually formed a closer relationship with her than they ever did before. 
	Because my brother and I were just more motivated, because they weren't each seeing their separate friends, so we connected them on the phone so they could talk and play this game together at the same time. But yeah, that was in a private room with, with, I'm trying to keep an eye on who else is joining. And these games, if all on the developers' side, they absolutely could make it safer.
	First of all, as long as it's definitely not made with kids in mind, and YouTube made YouTube Kids, but you can't block out... I don't know. Maybe there needs to be more pressure. I just feel like YouTube shouldn't be something that you can't say, ""Look, I don't want it on this computer.""

Because, to pry him away from the screen, when that's been his lifeblood over more than a year, it's going to be very hard to get him biking, and hanging out with friends, and whatever. I think it's going to be hard.
	Just because they do talk over games with his specific friends, it's going to be step-by-step and two steps backwards, several times. I mean, you really have to gird yourself for...

We felt safe that they could be at home and on Zoom and listening to teachers, interacting with friends, trying to be a little bit social online and just being part of the classroom setting. I guess that was positive. I'm actually glad that they're home and they won't be going until September. We made that choice.

As I said, I have seven children, and you can imagine what was going on in this house, seven different devices, eight different devices because my husband was working from home too. We didn't even have them. My daughter runs down, she starts kicking my husband off the computer, ""I'm late for class,"" and he is talking to a patient. Thank God our kids all went back in September. One kid had to quarantine for two weeks because someone in her class got it, but other than that, they've all been in school and we are so grateful for that because the online learning was terrible. My daughter who's five now, but she was four when the pandemic started, a four year old gains nothing from online learning. Even when she went back to school, she wasn't in every day, I didn't put her on the day she was on. I'd rather take her to the beach or take her to the park and give her real-life experiences where she's gaining as opposed to just watching the screen.
	My high school kids hated it, my teenage girls, because the social interaction wasn't there. They were texting in the middle of classes. Someone said to me, ""You're going to let them do that?"" I said, ""Well, they talk in class. Let's be real. They need the socialization."" I did let them text during class. Overall, I don't like to get my kids online, I don't like the texting, I don't like the phones, and it made it much harder to limit it. My 13 year old was ADHD, he was playing Lego during class.

They just stacked on the assignments. There were times we would just spend until midnight completing one assignment because in between, we'd just be running around the apartment, there were just so many tantrums. It's their way of reacting to this pandemic and the sudden change of environments. I get it, but I actually put them into a school. It is structured, but not as negative as what people say.

I mean, another thing is that my daughter has never regularly woken up even at seven. Like she's been waking up basically between 6:00 and 6:30 her whole life. And before, she would wake up me and my husband at that time, and it was very difficult for her to occupy herself until a time that we wanted to wake up on the weekends.",negative
lowpiu_group,3,2,2,"I had a quick question. So for Parent 2, I think it was on Monday, I'm not sure Moderator 1 if you were in that focus group, but there was one particular focus group, where all the moms were telling us about Discord. And how it has such a negative impact on their child. They were talking about issues with cyber security, and the fact that schools have their children using Discord, but it has had a much more negative impact on their child. So Parent 2, of you, since you mentioned it, I wanted to know... And Moderator 1, I hope this is not like jumping the gun, but I just wanted to know, for you Parent 2, just your thoughts on Discord. Maybe because your son is older, compared to the other moms, if that is the reason why there's a difference in how Discord is being used. Have you had any talks? And this is for all parents as well.

She watches videos for like an hour, or makes videos, or researches whatever she's interested in. She's learned to Google stuff, she's learned to Google how to rotate her monitor. She's just really into it, and we get to sleep in. And I mean, I guess sometimes there's technology usage and we prefer that there wouldn't be, but overall, I think the whole thing has been really positive. And now they're back in school all the time, and I don't know. I'm pretty happy that they've learned these skills, and honestly it's a huge win for me and my husband to be able to sleep in on the weekends, and not be up at 6:30 every day.",negative

Would have been delighted to go back, would have been overjoyed to see her friends everyday, and have the normal high school experience again. But it's really been mixed. For one thing, it's exhausting sitting in class all day now. Getting dressed, going to school, having to navigate all the social stuff that she could block out before. So we've been talking a lot about it, about what is this... She's not in school full time yet, just two days a week, but we've been talking a lot about what it'll be like in the fall, when she has to go every day. She agrees that it hasn't been 100% great.

It's more like extra support, it's a diagnostic tool as well, and they used it this year as well. But it's basically, in school, they would do the diagnostic to see what level the kids are in math and reading, and then after that, at home, they basically, on their own pace, they had to do a certain amount of i-Ready a day, a week, it depended on the teacher, but it was between 30 minutes, or 40 minutes, or it could have been an hour a week in total.

If you each can just tell me more about how your children used technology for educational purposes prior to the pandemic. Was it beneficial? Did you have problems with it? This is before quarantine started. If we can remember that far back.,1,"Yeah, our kids were full remote, so they were on technology from 8:00, about 8:30 in the morning, to about 2:00 every day, it depended on the school schedule. So they had things throughout the day, so I think they had about, on average, two and a half hours of live meetings on Zoom or Google Meets with the teacher or in small groups. And some time was given for i-Ready, which they kept using remotely. Some time was also asynchronous work, so to complete some worksheet or some kind of like... They also used, I think Pearson owns it, Savvas for their math. So they did that. The only real issue we had with technology was some of the apps didn't always work. So initially, we had the kids on the iPad and we noticed that the iPad wasn't as compatible with some of the programs, so it was very frustrating, so we switched them to a computer, a PC, each.",negative

This is before quarantine started. If we can remember that far back.,1,"And also the parental controls on the PC because I've noticed that my daughters kept flipping back and forth because we had to have things like YouTube open because the teachers would use it in school and the kids would just watch YouTube for hours and hours and hours or they would play games like Minecraft and flip through it. So once we were onto it, we could ban or block certain things, but it wasn't easy because they were on technology all the time and it was six hours of that or seven hours of that. I felt like my older daughter did better, she's a little bit more self-reliant in her personality, so people distract her, so compared to school, she was really advanced and she finished really early and she did a lot more enrichment. My younger daughter, she struggled a lot more keeping focused, she needed almost like that physical school environment because she was distracted by the technology, all the apps that were on the computer.",negative
lowpiu_group,3,3,3,What challenges do you think will come up as they go back to school full-time?,2,"I personally think it's going to be hard, it's going to be a transition. They have to get back adapted to the structure and the rules and the being in the class for so many hours. Just waking up in the morning, getting dressed, leaving. I think they're going to have to get used to all that all over again, so. And as far as the teachers, I don't know, I don't know what to tell them, I commend them though because I know it's going to be hard, you know.",negative
lowpiu_group,3,3,3,What challenges do you think will come up as they go back to school full-time?,1,"That's funny because I'm actually a teacher, I teach high school, so it's been hard, the remote. So there's certain things I liked being a teacher remote versus in the classroom. But my older daughter, she's moving into middle school, so the transition shouldn't be too... She's already transitioning, so I feel like, for her, it will be easier. But my younger daughter, because she's continuing elementary school, I think she's going to have more of an issue with that structure. You need the bathroom at home, you just get up and go.",negative
lowpiu_group,3,3,3,What challenges do you think will come up as they go back to school full-time?,1,"Food is better at home, those little things. She also got annoyed with other students when students would act inappropriately on the chat or call out. And I noticed that was the one frustration with the remote because she's like, ""I can't believe [inaudible 00:25:25] is talking over the teacher."" So I'm wondering if that's going to be a frustration more in the environment because that's something that's even... You have a lot of controls online, you can turn off chat, you can silence students, mute everybody.
	But she does have a para physically, so I think that's going to also help her because this year, because the para was also remote, it was all phone conversations. And I think she almost needed that physical organization. And I also think handwriting, everything was typed, everything was recorded, Flipgrid or anything else. But the kids didn't really write for 14 months, they didn't hold a pen for 14 months, so that's another transition. There's certain things, like the state tests, unless you have an accommodation where you have that writing accommodation, which we might really go for, but the idea that you don't even think about these things or the remote situation hinders it.",positive
lowpiu_group,3,3,3,What challenges do you think will come up as they go back to school full-time?,2,"Well, my kids, they did some writing. I would have to go to the school, pick up books for them, and things like that, so. I mean, because I have a kindergartner, he was in kindergarten, and then I have my daughter who participated in the program. My son didn't participate in the program, my daughter's the one who participated. But dealing with them both doing this remote thing, my son didn't even get to start at the big school, as we call it, yet, so.
	But my daughter, she had all her IEP, she had speech therapy, she had extra special ed, I guess, it's special classes, special, extra alone time with a specific teacher that just works with her individually because of the ADHD. And if they had been in school for this school year, she would have got a lot of in-person time with whoever she needed to. But because it was remote, I feel like she probably didn't get as much time with everybody as she should have. So I'm excited that they'll be going back in September so that they can get the hours that they need, that they really need, or that they should have gotten this year but they didn't.",positive
lowpiu_group,3,3,4,Do you have any other concerns or comments you want to make about what your children's technology use was like during quarantine?,3,"For me, I think the challenge and the thing that is more concerning is the emotional and psychological and self-esteem. I'm a single mom, I only have one child, but what I notice in general, and he's going on fifth grade, and he can't wait to go in person. But I think the curriculum and many other things, we can support them, but there's a part of them emotionally that I hope they have enough understanding and empathy around them to make them feel safe enough to express how they feel. That, to me, it's been one of my biggest concern.",negative
lowpiu_group,3,3,4,Do you have any other concerns or comments you want to make about what your children's technology use was like during quarantine?,1,"Oh, I agree. It was very isolating for the kids. I mean, I'm lucky that the girls are so close together because they have each other to talk to, but they're still siblings, so they miss their friends. They were very isolated from other kids. So just even that interaction, even talking to other people. And I don't know about the long-term health effects too because I noticed that Parent 1, Child 2 did this weird blinking thing by the end of the school year with her eyes. And I'm like, ""Is that anxiety? Is that eye strain?"" But I cut them off technology after the school year was over and it seemed to go away, so I'm wondering if it's just that intense... When they're staring on the computer screen, they don't take breaks like adults. Adults might say, ""All right, I'm doing this, I'm writing this email, I'm going to take a 15-minute break.""

lowpiu_group,3,3,4,Do you have any other concerns or comments you want to make about what your children's technology use was like during quarantine?,1,"Yeah, that regulation wasn't there.

We're in Minnesota right now, we've been doing a road trip. So we left the tablets home. I only have my laptop and my phone to take pictures and the computer to book hotels and watch Netflix, but that's it. It is complete cold turkey and they haven't asked for it. The only technology they have is, I got them Kindles, so they're reading a lot, which is [crosstalk 00:31:10].

lowpiu_group,3,3,4,Do you have any other concerns or comments you want to make about what your children's technology use was like during quarantine?,3,"So, I have a question and I don't know if this is part of the conversation, there's an incognizance for how our childrens are going to deal when the new year starts and how all this emotions and stress and anxiety may hit. And a lot of families don't have sometimes the opportunities, for example, to travel like that. And they still at home, they still in the city. How can we support childrens as we sort of moving into ""our new normality,"" but the childrens under 12 are the most at risk right now, not only for this new virus and all of this, but also the emotional?
	And I think we've been all living in a certain bubble, and yesterday, I got on the subway for the first time, and the subway got stuck in one part, and I literally, for the first time, I thought I was going to have a panic attack. So I'm thinking, I'm an adult and I'm able to control because I am a Buddhist, I meditate, I have tools. But I just got on the subway not even thinking how it's going to hit me. And I kept thinking about how childrens are going to feel and act when they go back to school and how can we support them without putting too much our own anxiety into them? I feel like childrens in many way have been my second heroes after nurses and doctors because they've been more resilient and more empathetic with this than sometimes the adults. But my concern is how we moving forward and how can we support them and catch little things to give them the tools or at least support?",negative
lowpiu_group,3,3,4,Do you have any other concerns or comments you want to make about what your children's technology use was like during quarantine?,3,"Because during this year, for example, I put my kid in this acting classes on Zoom because he's a fan of [Dogman 00:33:57] and I found this remote acting class and it was great. We go on the bike, we take walks, we read every day, a real book, for 20 minutes, I sit with him, one page him, one page me.

We're like, ""We haven't seen so many moths come out."" But it's part of the fun. But I think with kids being resilient in these [inaudible 00:34:53] September, it has to be a community working with the school and having a plan because I know they were pushing the social, emotional piece within my school and within the kids' school, so that has to continue. And it has to be a community effort because that's the bubble we're in, that's the pod we're in with those people, and how can we support each other.
	And I think also tone down the fear, I know the variant... I mean, I follow the news. The variant is scary, but just seeing life in the Midwest, people here are completely different than the city. I know it's a smaller population, the town we're in right now, it's like 1,500 people, but people are just living their lives, the kids are just running around. So it's interesting to see the different perspectives. And I think part of it is because we're from New York and we have so many people that live around us, so any outbreak is a lot more serious than in the Midwest. But it's just like, has this also consumed our lives to the point that we're not even living?",positive
media_group,3,1,2,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,5,"My son goes to our charter school. Before the pandemic, he was using computers to do most of his work at home. But it was really just about schoolwork. So it wasn't doing anything above and beyond that. I definitely found that it was beneficial because he was able to access more materials. When I think of school books, I don't know, an Encyclopedia Britannica just always pops into my head. I'm like, at least you don't have to walk around with this large book, but now you have access to all of that content and much more. That's kind of the framework that I've always been able to use. But I didn't feel like he understood that at that time. Being able to go on Google and just search, I mean, it wasn't something that he really understood at the time.",positive
media_group,3,1,2,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,1,"It was pretty minimal for school. It was mostly, I mean, they did use some Chromebooks for some projects at school that they share. She was in a public school, she still is. But overall, the use of the computer was mostly to do research, for project-based stuff. And punctually to, I mean, in fifth grade more than in sixth, strangely enough, there's a lot of use of Google Class, submitting essays, and things like that, but it was still very minimal.",negative
media_group,3,1,2,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,4,"My child also had access to the computer before the pandemic at school. He also learned [inaudible 00:19:59] at school. It was somewhat minimal. What I love then was that he would come back home, and use the computer for his assignment and most of his thing, and then he was more confident using the computer than writing. And I was trying to get him an access or get the accommodation for assistive technology for him all through the pandemic. And while working, they had to evaluate him and saw that it was more better for him to be on the computer, to use computer for his academic work more at school because it wasn't restricted somehow with the use of computer at school.
	But when he got home, he did everything on the computer. And also, not just for academic work, he also did it for his games and every other thing. But when he transitioned to remote learning now, he's also gained confidence, independence in using everything on the computer. So that's why I say it's half-half. The other half is no. It's complete reliance on the computer. Now you can't get him off it, you can't tell him to stop. You give him a time, he [inaudible 00:21:23]. They will scream and shout.

media_group,3,1,2,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,3,"My son before the pandemic was mostly iPad for his ... He had an accommodation. So he would use the iPad occasionally, but nothing crazy. I mean, nothing obsessive. Since the pandemic, it has gone to zero to 100. As soon as they closed the school down, as soon as de Blasio said, ""School's closing,"" it literally went from zero to 100. It's just like he's obsessed with it. Very similar experiences to Parent 4. He does not want to get off of it. It is a constant fight. It is a constant battle of putting in appropriate guidelines. It is a push and shove it. I feel bad some days because I'm like, ""You can't use it except only for school."" But then at the same time because of the pandemic, that's how he socializes a lot of time with his friends. So it's almost like, ""Well, do I punish him by taking away the one thing he really holds most dear to his heart? But then if I do that, I take away his ability to socialize with his friends."". It's a very tough seat. I'm like on a seesaw. It's constancy seesaw, it's a constant weighing the pros and the cons. He's a high functioning ASD. He's got essentially Asperger's and ADHD so he gets hyper-focused and very upset very easily if his hyper focus if it's cut off.

media_group,3,1,2,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,2,"My son's older through all these kids, but he's still trying to get his diploma from high school. He had a lot of issues on top of the ADD, he had some depression, and PTSD. We recently moved out to Maine. So now we're out of New York City and we're in the country. When he was in New York City and school's opened, being accepted to use the computer to hand in assignments, answer emails from teachers, that kind of thing. So he spends a lot of his time on the computer with gaming.Technology has always been his thing. One, I think it just gives him something to do. That takes his brain away from everything else that's going on in his life. But school-wise, there was in-person learning so he didn't ... The transition to in-person learning, I mean, strictly computer learning has been difficult with him because he's actually a social kid. I think so beforehand, so when the pandemic first started, he was like, ""This is awesome, because I'm an introvert and now I don't happen to see people."" [inaudible 00:25:58] really quick. Now a lot of his stuff is he communicates with school and teachers and advisers, friends. I mean, again, there's a lot of online gaming that he does and he actually even streams movies and television and stuff.It's always been hard for him to regulate that. Now that he is an adult and taller and stronger than I am, it's hard for me to kind of step in. I can't move on or just physically take it away from him.He has a job, which has helped.

media_group,3,1,2,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,1,"I don't know. It's been ... I mean, because she was remote for a certain time ... I mean, it was horrible.It started well. And then it went to [inaudible 00:28:05] so much more that ... I mean, with her psychiatrists, we had to decide to use medication because it was too much. Then she was on blended learning, which ended up being remote for most of the time. Interestingly enough, the blended time was horrible when she was at home because it was asynchronous learning. So the fact that she was not engaged with a teacher and had to work independently using tools, I mean, we had to spy remotely on her computer because, I mean, it's Netflix, it's anime. We're in anime Japanese World 24/7 so much that she would even hide the laptop under her bed so that we forget about it and pull it out at night. We'd find her in the closet in the middle of the night watching anime. And she said, ""I don't remember. I must have been sleepwalking."" Those times were hard. I don't know if it's maturity. I mean, it's hard. The remote school thing, I mean, it's constantly needing to juggle between trying to get her to be independent and also have her accept that we're still her parents, and we have to be teachers at the same time. We're in that really weird role of having to do both. Overall, I mean, she's a trooper for most of the time and medication had helped with the crisis and the fact that we put a doorstopper, like one of those remotes so she can't slam the door anymore and break the wall, all of that helped. I think the combination of both. I think the crisis, the pandemic coupled with so much screen time, the need of escapism, I don't know who brought that up earlier that, all of that combined with her anxiety was a wonderful melting pot.

media_group,3,1,2,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,6,"Okay. I have an 11-year-old boy who is in sixth grade, and I have a seven-year-old girl who is in first grade. Prior to the pandemic, I don't believe that they really use too much of the computer before for schoolwork, because they just had live classes. If they had to research something, my son, but not really, my daughter, too much. And the only time they ever really used gadgets and electronics is for pleasure or after school. But once the pandemic started, he came home with a Chromebook, and this is the end of it for us.
	My son is ADHD, he does not take any meds. But I was fully remote with them when it started and was able to sit and watch these classes go on. At first, it didn't seem like much. It seemed like it was actually working with him, to helping him kind of some of the issues he was having in physical form in school he wasn't having so I thought like, ""This is good. It's working for him."" But that was not true. Like the other woman was saying how they would submit documents or the homework, and it would be submitted and you think it's done, the thing is blank.I realized that all these assignments, I mean, it was a huge issue because he had 16 assignments that he did not do in his strongest subject, which is even worse. It was dribs and drabs of many things with half of the work. I find that they've gone through so many changes as far as technology goes. Just being on it all day and then being on it for pleasure. I don't know, for me, I find that although I am handling a kid who is just starting puberty so I know that you get a lot of other things that come with that as far as friction with rules and stuff. We've argued more than ever, ever before. It is a constant argument about like, ""It's so easy to work. All you have to do is show your face, ask a question, and submit the work."" 
	The grades are watered down. I feel like the technology has just they justify the scheduling as though when you look at it like, ""They're going to have two hours of live Zoom."" But the two hours of live Zoom is just live. It's not the 10 hours or the eight hours that they spend a day on it to do the work, to do the Zoom, to do the rest, and then everything else. It has not been good on this end. For him, especially. For my daughter, not as much of an issue. But for him, yes. 
	And just to note, they've done remote, they've done in school, which they called kind of a hybrid. But it's still remote. It's still remote in a building. It's not remote in your house, because they're doing it off the computer. It's not like they're having live actual instruction like they used to. They're still with the same overstimulation and everything else that goes along with that. I haven't found anything really positive to say about it at all",negative
media_group,3,1,3,what do you anticipate as people return to in person. Do you have concerns? Is there anything about the educational technology would like to see continue? Is there anything that you hope will end?,3,"Okay. Real quick. Both my kids, my son is ADHD and ASD, my daughter is ADHD and learning disabilities. But I had to make the choice because of the sentiments that everyone said, I had to make the choice to put them in Catholic school this year, because I needed him to be in-person at least five days a week. And that was a financial decision that was not taken lightly. I actually found probably one of the cheaper, less expensive Catholic schools to put them in for five days a week. And even then, there was still points where he was fully remote because maybe someone was self-professed positive test for COVID. He actually tested positive for COVID as well so he was fully remote for three weeks, several times since September, we've been remote. So it's been very difficult.
	Even in person, it's still very difficult. Because he still has people who are also remote in his classroom so that's also a big thing. That's also another distraction for him in class. So that's a different type of distraction. He's getting in-person but there's other kids who are being remote. So that's another distraction for him, which is another ball of wax. That when it's to distraction, he comes home, like today, he came home and it was obviously a very bad day for him because it was a very bad car ride for me. It was bad.Exactly. My daughter, she even goes to a charter school and they were remote three days and in-person two days. Now they are remote one day, in person four days. But she has her own paraprofessional so it's a little bit easier for her but she gets overwhelmed. Her ADHD is more of the impulsive. I think I chalk it up to her being a girl. She's not as much as emotional as he is. He's very emotional. It causes a whole different ball of wax because like I said, if he's had a bad day at school, we are all going to have a very bad day at home. ",negative

She's really happy every time she comes home, much more cooperative, it's still difficult to get her out of bed. It's awesome when she's in school for all of us. She keeps saying she miss being home. The concern I have is that where I'm hoping we're going to be able to go back five days a week. But the two concerns that I have about really as more and more kids transition to going back fully in school is addressing any form of, for lack of a better word, PTSD. I did bring it up at the school as part of the SLT to what are they going to do for social and emotional well-being of the kids when they go back to school.
	The other thing that I would like to see taught in school is form of online ethics. I don't know. The fact that kids trust so much what they see and read online, and it would be great if there was a class about helping them learn about cyber security, being able to recognize on their chat rooms when there's possible grooming, phishing and all of that, and understanding that there's no privacy once you're online. It's not private, it's public. So all of that is something that, especially after seeing what ... They communicate in so many different places online and I can't control all of those chat rooms. There's [inaudible 00:47:18] publicly know that. And I think for their own safety, I think it would be great that ...My biggest concern with returning for my child is ... Like I said, I shared a little bit earlier is how he's going to be able to control his body. Again, when he was home, I'm not restricting him as far as controlling his body. But at school, they consider it as safety issue because if he's tapping or he's putting his pencil on top of ... I mean, there's plenty of chairs that my son has broken while he's been ... Folding chairs that he's broken because he's lean back on them or things like that. But that's home. School is a different story, that's a big like, ""Oh, my gosh, that's so insane."" I'm really worried about that and how that transition from being ...
	And then he also hasn't been out as much, either, because he's been so bogged down with schoolwork. So I'm worried about the overstimulation because even for myself, my youngest starting into school, so I started to drop her off to school and pick her up. Just the fact of me going out for three hours a day, I come back so tired because I feel like I'm so overwhelmed with everything that I had to pay attention to and monitor that I didn't have to do for a year. So I'm concerned of how that if it's bothering me as an adult, I can only imagine how that's going to reflect on them.",negative
media_group,3,1,3,what do you anticipate as people return to in person. Do you have concerns? Is there anything about the educational technology would like to see continue? Is there anything that you hope will end?,4,"I would say my son's school is not going back this session. They are going to be remote throughout this session, because he goes into charter school. Doing good independently. Unlike before, when he goes to school, he is not writing any notes, he's not doing anything. I get all these phone calls, emails. He has to come back home, I have to start writing, I have to start the homework, helping with most of the homework. Type it or write it in his notebook, because some of his teachers will insist that they want the note and it has to be updated. So I have to just write the note for him. He's back, less work for me now because he works independently, he's able to do his homework on his own on his computer, turns it in at the right time. I don't have to do all this paperwork for him. But my concern is now when he goes back to school, to him, he doesn't want to go. He wants to stay remote. He prefer in remote because he's able to do his work and is able to get ...He wants to stay at home because he's able to do his work better and turns his own work faster. It doesn't have to do with all this side things like bullying, maybe harassing and the treatment from all those mates at school. He's in his pace at home, he moves around. Although he gets distracted sometimes. Just YouTube while the class is on, so he gets ... The teacher calls him, he's fumbling on his [inaudible 00:49:40] to respond and all those things.I have to go back to ... We'll be writing most of the time [inaudible 00:49:47] close to him. And when the teacher [inaudible 00:49:53] the teacher talk, put on the volume so I can hear and know when they him and just direct him and assist him. So going back to school next session is a problem that he doesn't want to think about for now. Because since the pandemic, he refused going anywhere. He doesn't trust anything. He doesn't even trust the vaccine. I told him I took the vaccine, I'm okay. He still does not because it was too fast to develop the vaccine. He's autism with ADHD, anxiety from depression, and all of those things with it.
	My concern is going back. And as Parent 1 said, internet safety, very, very important. How will the school handle this when they go back? Sometimes he goes on some sites, and he just gets up and starts screaming and running around, ""I'm scared, I'm scared."" He can't sleep, he can't do anything because of some things that he saw when he was on that site. I have a nephew in England, his age, too, 13-year. And he is all over the world with people that he doesn't know. He also has autism. There was a time he told his mother he was leaving London to go to Birmingham to meet somebody that he had been communicating with on the internet. How do they recognize the good ones from the bad? How do they recognize who they are really chatting with when they're online? This is a very big issue and a concern to me, actually.",positive

He's right now in the process of deciding whether or not he wants to go to a community college or going to a trade. I'm actually looking forward for him being out of the house and coming into contact with people. Because what I've been finding with him is that he has been getting along and listening to erroneous news, fake news, basically.
	Some of this is also just being antagonistic and wanting to be. He just wants to do a reaction. He says something reactionary about everything that's going on from the pandemic itself, from vaccine, Black Matter, Asian sentiments that's been going on. It's just driving me crazy. And he needs to get out into the world instead of being locked up into this little box where he's controlling what information he's getting. That's what I want.",negative

Is there anything that you hope will end?,6,"No. I was just going to say one of the things that I think really kind of concerns me is that as he's gone back into the building ... My children go to charter school as well. And they've created so much about wearing a mask, and my son, he's at home, he's not going to wear a mask in our house. So much emphasis on it. Even wearing a mask while they went to recess and his mask fell down a little bit under his nose, and they stopped him from recess and were like, ""No, you have to. Your mask were down."" I mean, some of the things are getting so kind of, for me, a little ridiculous that it's you're breathing your own CO2 all day, getting headaches, all this stuff. If the kid is going to go outside, then let him breathe the fresh air. They don't have to be next to each other. He can run alone, he doesn't need anybody running with him. He has so much energy. But it's like they're getting so ... There's so much more anxiety build up that it just doesn't help. And the thing is when you have a kid like mine, super sensitive, he's very affectionate, he doesn't like ... For him to socialize with the new kids because he went into the school last year. So he didn't even really make friends when March came around. It's like he had no roots. He was in another school for four years. So it's like how do you make friends with people if you don't get close to them? He's a very touchy feely kid. And it's like, ""Now this touchy feely kid was trying to make friends. Now has to be ..."" The expectations, especially when they know your kid has special needs and special attentions and accommodations, that they don't really look at those things fully. And everybody's on someone's scale and it shouldn't be that way. Because I feel like kids with accommodations, those needs have to be met because these kids ... I find my kid is zoning out like things don't matter. And you're talking about a kid who was honorable student. And it's how can this be affecting him in that way? That's all I wanted to say.",negative
media_group,3,1,3,what do you anticipate as people return to in person. Do you have concerns? Is there anything about the educational technology would like to see continue? Is there anything that you hope will end?,3,"I'm sorry, I'm just going to real quick ... I apologize. I'm not going to hijack this time. I was just going to say for us parents who have our children in charter. My daughter's charter is 65% IEP so that's a little different. But other charter schools, that's the thing about charters, that's the gamble. They kind of comply with the IEPs, they kind of don't but that's the thing about charters. We got to take it, we don't have to take it. Just depends on the charter. It's such a hard thing. And I know a lot of folks have just mentioned about keeping track of your kid online. 
	I put Bark on child's my laptop. It's B-A-R-K, it's an app that you download. You have to pay for it but at least it tells you if someone's fishing them. If someone's saying the key words and stuff like, that they send an alert to you. So that's B-A-R-K. I put Bark on my kid's laptop so I can get the alerts. At least, that would be like, ""Okay, let me figure this out."" But it is an awful ... It's such a hard time that we're all going through. Even I as an adult, one of my emails got like I got an alert, alert. It's on the dark web. I'm like, ""I don't even know what the hell the dark web is."" 
	We're exposing to our kids all of these things. And if your child has ADHD or ASD or ADHD with other comorbidities, it's even more difficult. Because it's like it's so hard to protect them. You want to protect them, you want to do what's best. But at this point in time, you don't even know what's best for your child. Because you know the COVID rate amongst kids is less than 1%. Going back to what she was saying about if your child is a social little person, then what are you going to tell them? Like, ""You can't be that social. You got to stay arms away."" But that's so difficult for a kid to comprehend that.
	I's very distressing. I'm not going to cry. But it's such a very distressing time that this is a distressing time for us as adults. It's an even more distressing time for our children. I know one mom just mentioned about the kid not being able to sit still. If that's the case, on your kid's IEP, you can get a sensory cushion and have that with your kid just so they can help. My son, for the longest time, I had him to have a sensory cushion. He was getting in trouble. He was sneaking ... In elementary school, he's in junior high school now, but he was sneaking into the classrooms, into the closets to inhale marker. That's not good. Like, ""Oh, no,"" right, exactly. He inhale marker. Well, that is a sign of anxiety. And I said to them, I'm like, ""When are you planning on telling me this? After he's graduated from smelling markers to something else? When are you planning on saying, 'Hey, your kid has anxiety?'""",negative

What social media is starting to ... I mean, he still hasn't really gotten on to it. The kid versions where he's able to connect with his cousins. I've also found that his relationships with school have not been the greatest because he hasn't been able to see them in person. But because he's able to see his cousin, those relationships have grown more. I'm not sure what the correlation is. It's been there. But that's who he's been in this space with. And very early on and a lot of you were talking about some of the challenges with navigating the world wide web with the children.
	One of the things that we did, there was a, I forget, I was trying to see if I could find it, but it was a video that kind of talks about kidnappings and things like that that were kind of happening. It was an actual show, and we sat down and we watched it. We had a long conversation afterwards. Like, ""This is why I don't want you having conversations about where you live or letting even ..."" Because he has a younger brother, I'm like, ""Even being able to communicate."" I said, ""Sometimes your brother might say something to give indicators about the community that we live in, that might lead them that much closer to the house."" So just helping them to be more aware of and be mindful of their surroundings and how the information might be perceived on the other side has been a big point for my husband and I and what we've been trying to relay to him. Because we want to have him to be more autonomous.
	I think somebody was sharing the site, I put on a blocker on the phone and on the computer as well so then I'm getting alerts where he's going to YouTube and some of these things. Because even videos that are coming up that are way too inappropriate, in my opinion, where they're showing crosses, devils, and all kinds of things. That's not something that I want my 12-year-old to be engaging and experiencing at this time. So the social media platform, I feel like has definitely expanded and is now more so like in the TikTok era, in the YouTube era. I know YouTube has been trying to do a lot to try to curb it but it's still not great. So those are just some of the things that I know that I've been doing to kind of manage it.",positive

media_group,3,1,4,"any concerns you had about social media prior to the pandemic, how that changed, benefits, concerns, just hearing both asides",1,"So social media, interestingly enough, I think it's been in a weird way better. I don't know if it's because she's maturing. Also, girls start social media, I think, earlier than boys in general. We had talks, we had contracts beforehand. There's no selfies allowed on Instagram. It's a way of showcasing art, it's not about looking how many likes. And it turns out that they don't really use Instagram the way that they were mostly about posting stories. So they're more in the Snapchat, in and out world of showcasing what they like.
	I think it's been really fun, because I can see what she's interested in it in things. And they've been really good conversation starters. Also, it's a great way of monitoring her growth and seeing who she's chatting with. It's been kind of interesting. The only thing that worries me in the social media world is all those. Because I discovered Discord, and then there's chat rooms and games. But there's also, what is that? There's that one game that everyone plays and all the adults love too. I forgot what it's called.Yes. It's been great. Strategy and fun. The only area that I worry the most is YouTube, I must admit, because that's the area where she feels very comfortable commenting on a lot of things, and not realizing that she still comments like a little girl, with mistakes and all that. So that's my only concern, but overall, I find, interestingly enough, a positive experience.",negative

I think for my little one ... My son is always on animes and looking at gamers showing videos of games and listening to commentary. I think he watches a lot of puppet show. Things I find very silly and immature. I'm like, ""Okay, not a big deal."" But my little one, she likes to watch all these toy openings and kids talking about things that they're opening and she wants a YouTube channel. But I have found that I had to put some blocks on there because I had a lot of completely sexualized, inappropriate things pop up that I was mortified that she was on it and it was ...

You're going to be like ... And it was so instinctual. She was trying to hide. And I was like, ""How can this just come up out of nowhere?"" There was like nothing that she was on before. I feel like the bad guy because I had to completely stop it. Like, ""No, you can't get on it."" And she said, ""But I just want to see the video of the games and the kids. I want to have my own channel.""
	And I'm just like, ""This kind of stuff. I can't have porn going in front of my seven-year-old. This is highly problematic."" I find that even when you do it and you do the YouTube for kids, it's not even that safe either because there's some anime styles that are just, for my taste, a little too much at this point in time. I feel like they haven't been able to have so much happening. We couldn't go on vacation because of COVID and everything. When it first happened, we had to cancel. I feel like they've lost so much that the one thing they have is the internet. And it's now I have to be the bad guy and say, ""No, you can't be on this.""

media_group,3,1,5,how did your child's use of technology for school purposes changed during the pandemic? Was it beneficial? Did you have concerns or find it problematic? ,1,"I don't know. It's been ... I mean, because she was remote for a certain time ... I mean, it was horrible.It started well. And then it went to [inaudible 00:28:05] so much more that ... I mean, with her psychiatrists, we had to decide to use medication because it was too much. Then she was on blended learning, which ended up being remote for most of the time. Interestingly enough, the blended time was horrible when she was at home because it was asynchronous learning. So the fact that she was not engaged with a teacher and had to work independently using tools, I mean, we had to spy remotely on her computer because, I mean, it's Netflix, it's anime. We're in anime Japanese World 24/7 so much that she would even hide the laptop under her bed so that we forget about it and pull it out at night. We'd find her in the closet in the middle of the night watching anime. 
	And she said, ""I don't remember. I must have been sleepwalking."" Those times were hard. I don't know if it's maturity. I mean, it's hard. The remote school thing, I mean, it's constantly needing to juggle between trying to get her to be independent and also have her accept that we're still her parents, and we have to be teachers at the same time. We're in that really weird role of having to do both. Overall, I mean, she's a trooper for most of the time and medication had helped with the crisis and the fact that we put a doorstopper, like one of those remotes so she can't slam the door anymore and break the wall, all of that helped.I think the combination of both. I think the crisis, the pandemic coupled with so much screen time, the need of escapism, I don't know who brought that up earlier that, all of that combined with her anxiety was a wonderful melting pot. I mean, now it's much more under control. I mean, it's not perfect, but at least she doesn't have crisis as many, at all.",negative
media_group,3,1,5,how did your child's use of technology for school purposes changed during the pandemic? Was it beneficial? Did you have concerns or find it problematic? ,5,"When the pandemic started, they went completely virtual. And they tried, they did, they kept the same schedule as when they were in school, as far as hours were concerned. So his day starts at eight o'clock in the morning and goes until 3:45 in the afternoon. So typically, he'll go until 4:30. So he was pretty much in that space. They were doing 90-minute blocks. So they broke it down to do 35-minute blocks with a break before they went into the next. His level of focus, I guess it was good, because with his ADHD, he was able to make noise and kind of be in his face, and he was on mute so nobody really heard him. He's [crosstalk 00:32:33] stuff and doing things that keep his mind engaged.
	In school, it presents a problem where he would yell out a lot during his class sessions. I'm just envisioning, I'm like, ""Oh, my gosh. This is what you do in class and why the teachers are always having a fit and calling me and feeling like, 'What can we do to get him more focused?'"" He hasn't been taking his medicine during the pandemic. We've had some times where it's almost like a threat, like, ""If you don't focus, I'm going to make you take your medicine,"" kind of thing. Because the issue in class was he'll be in class all day but he wasn't doing any work. So his teachers would call me or they would text me, and there were like, ""He turned in work but it's all blank."" In addition to him having to do his night homework, he also now has to do all of the work that he didn't do for class during the day.
	He's pretty much on his computer from when he wakes up in the morning at 7:00 until going to bed at night at 9:00 trying to ... With breaks to kind of go to the bathroom and eat. It's a lot. It's overwhelming. A lot of times, just like Parent 1 was just saying, we had to do some stop gaps, too. We got the blink camera to put in the room so that I'm able to see or listen or hear. If he's listening or watching a video game or watching YouTube instead of participating in classes, I'm like, ""It has to be something more than you telling me that you're in class and you're not doing the work."" I had him sit in a room and it's difficult because I'm working and it's like, ""Okay, I'm trying to oversee,"" And like I said, I have three kids so I'm trying to [inaudible 00:34:33] all of them in virtual learning. And trying to keep them all up to par in what they're doing. I definitely felt that it was challenging.
	But the good parts about it were that he was able to connect with friends and family members that he wouldn't on a regular basis. On the weekends, if he did well in school, I'm like, ""Okay, then you can spend time with your family."" But that just meant more time on the screen. Maybe on a different type of device. Now, it's the TV instead of the computer. Or maybe it's his, what do you call it? His phone or other electronic devices. But it's still, to me, overkill. And I feel like when he goes back to school, I think it's just going to be much harder, because I don't know what the [inaudible 00:35:27] kind of does that look like. With overstimulation and then they go from overstimulation to something not so [crosstalk 00:35:35]",positive
media_group,3,2,1,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,6,"So before the pandemic I feel like, especially with technology, my kids didn't really have much at all that they had to do. My oldest is in sixth grade now, so I think that might have changed going to middle school, however, while they were in elementary school, they really didn't have any assignments that they needed technology for, for the most part. So it was rare. And then, of course, last March school went completely virtual and everything was online. So it was like a night and day change for us. It was a disaster, to be honest. Well, really, they're on all day. They're on all day. Now, one of my children is a really unique learner and one of them did okay. One of them was able to go on. But then one of them is really ... He's unique and his teacher not seeing him in person, it affected him. Even this year, for example, he started fully virtual at the beginning of the school year and his teacher, since she hadn't met him and she hadn't seen him in person, she didn't grasp that if he wasn't doing an assignment, it wasn't because ... He has ADHD and if he wasn't doing the assignment, it wasn't that he was trying not to do it, he was just having a hard time and she wasn't there to be able to intercept and to sit with him and to see how she could help him. She wasn't able to help him because she didn't know what the problem was because he wasn't there. Yeah. Now he's back full time and he is doing a lot better. Still, I feel like they're just online all day long and it's a problem. ",negative
media_group,3,2,1,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,1,"I might echo Parent 6 because, similarly, my son too, prior to the pandemic the most time he would spend on any electronic device was either in school for a computer media class and then after school or after homework, he'll have some free time, we call it free time, where he can play on his iPad or his cellphone for a couple of hours before bed. But, I mean, it was a total 180 where now he's fully remote. And actually, it was like a double whammy because I was actually diagnosed with breast cancer in February, so having this diagnosis and having the pandemic and then all of this pressure on my son to make sure that I'm healthy, make sure that he's doing well in school, it did take a negative toll at first. 
	But, again, through reading affirmative things and helping him along and making sure that he sees me in a not just a healthy state but also in a physically healthy situation, it helped him. But literally, his electronic usage went from pretty much nonexistent to almost 200%, because after school he goes directly to his iPad to play. When that dies, he goes directly to his iPhone and then if that dies, then he'll go to my computer to do classwork. It was like a never ending cycle and I have to break him off of it. I would try to have not just physical exercise but mental exercise as well when he's on break and when I also work remotely, fully remote, we would for lunch just go outside, take a walk, just talk about the sky or talk about the birds chirping. Something that we don't have to focus on where it's a problem or it's worrisome. That seemed to help for the time being. But I think when we come back indoors, it's back to the gadgets. 
	I would say his learning, his academics actually improved. He has an IEP. He has-Right. I mean, as much as he's on these devices, he actually improved academically because it enhanced some of his skills that he already had, his computer skills and navigating. He was able to work independently and actually become a leader in his class where he's in the chatroom trying to troubleshoot those who are even having technical difficulties logging on. It'd be so funny. But-Right. Well, can you help mommy record this Zoom? But I've seen and his teachers have also seen a very much more confident student and person overall. Not to take up too much time, but my son, he had confidence issues and wanting to be liked by everyone, wanting to be friends with everyone. But this past year especially, he really stepped up to the plate and actually became the leader confidently and was able to excel. So I'm very proud of him. I'm very proud of him. And I'm cancer free too. ",negative
media_group,3,2,1,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,4,"Okay, great. So it has had a negative impact on my household because it's too much computer time. And I remember those questions when I was filling out one of those questionnaires when I brought my daughter there to be evaluated. It was speaking about the problems in reference to the computers. I'm like, ""I don't have those kind of problems. What are they talking about?"" Now fast forward to this pandemic, now I understand. I'm having those problems. I'm having problems because now she wants to be on the computer all the time and it's hard for me to take it away because she has to do her schoolwork and she's learning remotely. 
	It's hard to sanction that because she'll say, ""Oh, I need to do my homework, or I need this app or that app."" It's just difficult to sanction the time so I have to let her use her computer but I catch her and she's getting in trouble with the computer because now all of these open sites and bringing up conversations that I never thought I would have to have with my 11-year-old daughter because she's on all of these different sites. And here, I'm putting in all these parental controls but she's very savvy so she can overstep those controls and now her and her friend and then teaching her how not to turn over your screen to your friend, I know you think is your friend, but there's so many things that you can get into problems with. 
	So for me, I'm just devastated by all of this computer time. And I have two children, so even the little one ... I mean, they need some in person. They need to not always have to rely on the computer. And that was my problem even before the pandemic because I saw the teachers were moving into having your children learn more with these apps. And sometimes I have to tell them it's okay for them to use pencil and paper because I feel you learn better, at least until you have the concept, then you can do it on the computer. Yeah. I'm not impressed with all of this, everything on the computer. For me, it's just a negative impact. ",negative
media_group,3,2,1,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,3,"Yeah. So before the pandemic, my oldest daughter who was then in eighth grade, she was the primary computer user in terms of schoolwork. But even then, she still had other things that she could use. She had texts that they would send home. She had articles that were printed out already or worksheets or things like that. She has some trouble with writing. She had OT to help her with writing for, I think it's dysgraphia. And it's much, much better now. So the computer, she tended to use it a bit for anything that involved writing and she did a lot of voice to text and things like that anyway, but she did have a lot of alternatives. 
	My middle daughter who is about to turn 11, she hardly used the computer at all. She used it sometimes for some research things if she was working on a project. But most of her work was either done in school or it was done on paper. It was read a book and write a paragraph or something like that. She was then in fourth grade. Then, of course, this hit and they were 100% learning online. 
	It was more successful for my fourth grader because her teacher had it organized. She would give them a checklist on Google Classroom so they could see what they needed to do each day. She would give them a preparation for what was coming up, like, ""Here's what the week will look like."" And she also had live class sessions and she had it broken into ... She did three meetings per day, and one was a morning meeting to talk about the plan for the day, then she would give them an assignment, then she would have them meet back again an hour later to check in about the assignment and do the next thing. And then in the afternoon she did some small group work. 
	Where it was really challenging is that my daughter is in a French dual language program and so, of course, and we're anglophone, so that just dropped. I mean, that's one reason why her teacher tried to do a lot of small group work to try to help build that up, but that was certainly a challenge for us. We had to try to find ways to help her be exposed to the language so she wouldn't lose her ability then for starting fifth grade and then struggling. 
	But my eighth grader, some of her teachers were amazing with checking in and having office hours and doing some instruction and tutoring and things like that online and some of them, it was like they just were phoning it in at the end of the semester and she was teaching herself. And that was very difficult. This year, it's changed because now she's in high school and she's at a performing arts school. It's been a real challenge because her art is violin and it's really hard to do instrumental work with groups Zoom. They've done their violin lessons on Zoom but it was just one on one. But her orchestra class, they really haven't done any orchestra all year because you can't really do an orchestra on Zoom. There's a lag between the things. So that's been a little bit of a challenge. 
	But she's had all live classes online this year, because their school, that's how they set it up. That has been fantastic. Because it's enabled two things to happen. One is that because she does have ADHD and she has a really hard time organizing herself, she doesn't really have to organize herself because she's in the lessons all day. And then she has a little bit of homework to do, but it's not an extreme amount. And they do a lot of breakout rooms and stuff so she's able to do some small group work and it helps her, I think, because she doesn't have to be teaching herself. 
	It also helps because when I'm home, I'm hearing what she's learning in class. That's been really great. With all my kids, hearing their teachers teaching them online, I've been blown away by the skill of these teachers. They're amazing. And the thoughtfulness that they put into their projects and developing their curriculum, it's just outstanding and I feel like that's been a great gift to have that insight. And it's also helped me when it comes time for me to help them, because I can say, ""Oh, no. Remember, Mme Simone was saying that you needed to do this with this project. Yeah. I understand you forgot that, but I heard her say it so let's do that."" So that's been helpful. It's been good. Yeah. The challenge that we've had with mostly my middle daughter is that she also has anxiety and OCD and so she, first of all, can go down a rabbit hole when she's just learning online. Secondly, this year she's been doing blended learning so when she's in school, she's doing all right. When she's at home, she gets almost no work done. I mean, she's been working today and as of the time I came in here, I think she had done one math problem. She just has a really hard time. And I have to see her screen at all times. If I can't see her screen, she's not doing what she's supposed to do and that's [crosstalk 00:38:49]-And that makes problems because then I have a five-year-old, and if I have to look at the screen all day of her older sister, I can't be doing things with the five-year-old. And my five-year-old then spends a lot of time coloring or playing with magnet tiles or watching videos because I have to keep saying, ""I'm sorry it's a beautiful day. We can't go outside. I have to make sure your sister's doing her work."" We've had to do that too. We have to lock them in a room. Would it be all right if I just add something to what you ...Okay. So there were two things that Parent 5 said that reminded me of stuff with my kids. One of them was that the addiction to the screen time is followed by this ... In the beginning of the pandemic at least, we really had to force them to go outside. One of my kids just had a meltdown yesterday because we had to go to in person violin lesson because her teacher resumed that. She says, ""I don't want to go outside. I don't want to go outside."" So definitely there's been an element of ... Once they're out, it's okay but it's like leaving the apartment has become a bigger deal. And one of my kids, she had almost lost complete contact with friends until she consciously ... We both, we planned it out. You've got to start contacting your friends because it just slipped away. 
	The other thing I wanted to say, which Parent 5 was talking about her son's skills with the technology and it's not just the Zoom or the Google Classroom or Google Meet, but my kids have used so many more different types of programs like Flip Grid. They're creating presentations with Google Slides. They're using special effects in their presentations. They're creating videos. The one with the violin, she's working with something called Click Track so that she can coordinate her timing with the timing of someone else's playing so that they can line up their performance videos. They're doing animations for projects. That's been amazing to see that, because they've then been able to use what appeals to them and what works with their skillset and their abilities to do their assignments, because there's a lot of variability in how they present the information and then they've got this array of options through technology to work with and that's been a real gift as well. So it's definitely been a double edged issue. ",negative
media_group,3,2,1,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,5,"Yeah. Well, prior to the pandemic my kids were very exposed to technology. They were using it as well for school. They had a lot of apps for reading. My older son, Andrew, he has a-It was. It was because it was controlled. Whenever I needed to, I was able to put away the devices. But after the pandemic, like another mommy said, I have a problem taking the laptop away because he uses it for school. Now, the negative of it is my older son who has an IEP is becoming more addicted to the screen. If it's not the laptop, it's the iPad, when the iPad goes empty, it goes to my phone. He's just switching from one device to the other. But as far as school goes, he is doing amazing, a lot better than when he was in school. Remote has done wonders for us. He's more focused. He's totally in charge of his school day. I don't get involved. He gets great grades. And it helped us also with the transition. 
	I was very nervous about Andrew going into sixth grade. It's a new school, new teachers, new system. But that worked out so well for us because now he got to know all his teachers and he's doing great academically. He's doing amazingly. So that was very good. It's just that he's becoming more addicted and less socially involved and that's the part I'm not happy with. Yeah. Lucky for us, honest to God, I pray for these teachers. They're amazing. I don't know if it's us, we jut are lucky with the teachers he has. They're very dedicated. He has live classes. I don't feel like he's missing anything. And I also get to see how Andrew is like with his teachers and his classmates. And he takes charge also, like another mommy said. It was funny, I was laughing because he does the same thing. He gives everybody advice on technology. He's like the tech person in the class. Even his teachers, they tell me if Andrew's not there, we get nervous. He's enjoying it. I'm happy to see how he's like and he's doing great. And I feel like when this is all over, when school is over, I can go back to controlling device time, screen time. He's not going to give it up willingly. I'll have to hide devices like I used to before, which is fine. It used to work. So it's good. ",negative
media_group,3,2,2,"some people have gone back in person or you're anticipating going back in person, what are the challenges that you anticipate and are there parts of this that you hope will continue and are there parts of this way of educating kids that you hope will end? ",2,"I'll go. I guess I'm anticipating ... I would like him to go back to school. He's in ninth grade right now. So hopefully he'll be able to go back in person. He does have asthma so that's what I'm really concerned about, just him being in person. But I like the aspect that they can utilize their computers in the classroom. That's a good benefit. But I do like the teachers teaching live. That's another thing. But he needs that social skills. That interaction is what really ... It's just me and him in the house and I think we're both getting tired of each other talking to each other. He needs that input with other people, other teenagers his own age. 
	And I like that the teachers are incorporating all this new technology. He's learned how to type and just things he should have known how to do, and even learned life skills within the house, which is great. Just so we could incorporate all those things when they go back into the classroom. Yeah. If I could just briefly piggyback off of what everyone had shared is my son has been fully remote and I think with him graduating fifth grade, entering a new school sixth grade. That's already some pressure right there and whether or not he'll be in blended learning or in in-person learning full time, that's really dependent on the current environment around September. My son as well has asthma so, of course, that's always his health. His safety is always at the forefront. And my son, again, I had JD as an IEP so he's very hands on, visual type of student who requires that physical in person learning. It's not to say that he can do without, but in a physical classroom setting I feel that now that he's matured and has a little more confidence, he can enhance those skills better in in-person learning. 
	Again, I'm with Parent 5. We all have enjoyed being ... I'm a social butterfly, but I really am recluse as well. And I passed that along to my son. We've been home together during this time, however, it's going to be a change for the both of us. Myself, I'm being called back into work as well. So getting into a new normal, of course, it's going to take some adjusting to, but I'm sure that we can overcome any challenges that we face, especially if we are not only physically prepared but mentally prepared for it as well.

",4,"Yeah. I will be very excited when they go back in person. The part that the teachers are doing a fantastic job and I have to say they are going above and beyond during this remote learning. And I know one thing they said, ""Oh, my kid is so great. She's so great. She's doing so well. She's leading the class."" Yeah. She is doing a lot of that stuff because she's home with me every day and the teachers don't really have to deal so much with those behavioral issues because now all the behavioral issues are home with me so she can shine with them for the most part. But for my youngest one, she loves that in person and she needs that. For me, I'm working every day from home so to work every day from home and try to teach a third grader and a sixth grader, it's very difficult. So I definitely would love for them to be back in school and in person learning and they can use some of this technology and hopefully the teachers will continue to be as great as they've always been.

media_group,3,2,2,"some people have gone back in person or you're anticipating going back in person, what are the challenges that you anticipate and are there parts of this that you hope will continue and are there parts of this way of educating kids that you hope will end? ",1,"Hi. I'm looking forward to ... My daughter's about to start five days. She's been going three days, she's been going two or three days, my five and 11-year-old. It's been so exhausting. Well, it's enabled me to see where the problems and challenges are. I've asked for an IEP review because I'm like, ""These are some other issues that I didn't realize were going on."" It's been so exhausting and I haven't been able to do any of my work. As I think Parent 4 eluded to or said, it's a struggle to do anything you have to do when you've got these kids that you have to teach as well. So I'm looking forward to them being able to go into the classroom and do and have their learning more focused there. 
	And for my five-year-old, it's so important because of the social stuff and for my 15-year-old, she's just going to be starting back three days. And she's done really well with being fairly connected to people given that she's never stepped foot in her school. She's in ninth grade. But it's going to be great for her to be able to be there and really to connect with her teachers and with her classmates. What I'm worried about is that ... Well, two things. One, is it gets harder for the older one who needs a little bit more ... Who's not as self directed and so she's then more independent, which actually makes it a challenge for me to keep track of what's going on. 
	But my 11-year-old has so much anxiety, she gets so many physical symptoms of that, that she's had a lot of school refusal in the past. And having it be just two or three days was what kept us going this year, was you can go, you can have that time, but guess what? When she was refusing on a Wednesday, ""I'm not going to school. I feel sick. My stomach hurts. My head hurts."" We would say, ""But it's the last day of the week. Then tomorrow and Friday you're home."" So that was what kept us going. I'm not looking forward to those morning challenges again because I feel like it's going to be a lot for her because she's just so anxious. ",negative

And the only thing we miss really is the social aspect of being physically in school and the after school programs. I had them registered in chess, soccer, all these activities. But having them home has been awesome. So I think it's going to be difficult for all of us when they start going back to school. ",positive

They're really happy back in school full time now. My oldest is now in middle school so he had to wake up early. So he had to get on the bus-He had to leave at 7:00, so that's really his only complaint. Other than that, he said that he's really, really happy to be back in school. They're really enjoying being with the other kids. ",positive
media_group,3,2,3,"what was the social media and media used, and by media we mean YouTube or any kind of media that they're consuming. What was the use like before the pandemic, how has that changed? Any concerns, any benefits that you're seeing from changes in social media use? ",6,"So what's changed with the social media, so my kids, as I'm sure all the rest of the year kids do also, they really like Roblox and they want to play with their friends. So before it was more controlling, okay, you have this amount of time to go on YouTube, you have this amount of time to play. But now, when everybody was home, the Roblox playing with friends and talking on the phone at the same time was the only socialization that they had. That was their only option. So it got a little more and a little more and then they said, ""Oh, well, I'm playing with my friends so can I keep playing?"" So then that time extended a little bit. So it's hard when that is the only way that they could socialize or when they're on FaceTime, when they're going on FaceTime with friends. When that's the only way that they could socialize, that has been really difficult to reign it in and stop them from it. So we've been having a lot of challenges with that. 
	And then the YouTube videos start and that's when everything they have, like their school issued iPads, and so I could take away their own personal devices, but the school iPads have YouTube on them. So I can't ... It's for school so I can't just take it away. So then-they end up sneaking. Mm-hmm (affirmative). It's a lot harder. And sometimes I don't even want to because that's the way that they're able to socialize. They're starting to go to the park with kids and doing more now but it's been a challenge this whole time. ",negative
media_group,3,2,3,"what was the social media and media used, and by media we mean YouTube or any kind of media that they're consuming. What was the use like before the pandemic, how has that changed? Any concerns, any benefits that you're seeing from changes in social media use? ",3,"So I've had a very similar experience. My then eighth grader was already on social media because I reluctantly let her have an Instagram account because her class at school, her cohort, had a cohort Instagram chat going and they mostly used it for things like, ""Hey, I have a doctor's appointment today. Can anyone tell me what I'm going to miss in this class?"" For that type of thing. So they mostly used it well. There were some incidents though of kids sharing porn and things like that on it. That was obviously a problem. But this year, yeah, she's used it really ... That, and the other thing was SnapChat that I was like, ""You cannot have SnapChat. Absolutely not. It's like a sexual predator's playground."" 
	And then she had a friend, a pen pal in New Zealand, who she found out was on SnapChat. So then it was like, ""All right."" Kind of like Parent 6 was saying, that's how they connect. I mean, yes, they can write letters but it's so much more immediate and they socialize so much more so I was like, ""Fine, okay. You can use SnapChat."" So it was creeping up. But I think I have to have my rules. I have to have the passwords. I have to have access because I want to make sure that they're safe online. And so I periodically go in and check. 
	My 11-year-old doesn't have any of these accounts. What she has is YouTube and she's become obsessed with various YouTubers and it's prompted some discussions about what we value and what we don't. She definitely sneaks it when she's not supposed to. That's definitely been a challenge. And again, same thing, school computer, you can't exactly ... I mean, she does have to do work. It's been great in some respects because she's been able to use it for school, but also I don't really want you looking at these people and following what they're doing because I don't agree with it. 
	So, yeah. That's been a little bit of an issue. I've worried a lot about body image and things like that with them because I feel like when they're following these people on whether Instagram or YouTube or wherever else, a lot of these people are making tons of money as so called influencers and they have a very different lifestyle. And I feel like sometimes that's hard for them to see. But one of my kids went through a little bit of an issue around food and she was talking about like she wished she could be anorexic because she wanted to be a certain way and we had to have a whole discussion with the psychiatrist around that and talking about positive body image and stuff. And I think she seems like she's on a better path. 
	But I wanted to say one last thing about it, is that where it has been really good is that my oldest daughter, during this time, she seems to be like a lot of adolescent girls are, I'm reading, she's developed vocal and motor ticks, which is one thing I'm worried about when she goes back to school. At home she can hide it from people to some degree but when she's in person, it's a lot harder. But she's actually connected a lot with people on Instagram who also have some of these struggles and she's starting to talk about herself more as neurodivergent as opposed to having a disorder and things like that, and learning techniques for managing it. She'll say, ""Oh, I found out that so and so on Instagram has the same kind of ticks that I do and this is what she does to help herself. That's been fantastic, that it's really enabled her to develop a sense of agency around herself and her managing [crosstalk 01:01:17].Yeah, yeah. So that's been the positive, whereas the rest is like a minefield. ",negative
media_group,3,2,3,"what was the social media and media used, and by media we mean YouTube or any kind of media that they're consuming. What was the use like before the pandemic, how has that changed? Any concerns, any benefits that you're seeing from changes in social media use? ",4,"I have to say that my kids, even the eight-year-old, everyone wants to be a YouTuber. They want to be a YouTube star or they want to be famous or Instagram famous and that's killing me right now. Because with everything that's going on, you're like, ""What happened to I wanted to be a doctor or lawyer or teacher?"" Everyone want to be a YouTuber and even the eight-year-old. I'll go, ""What do you want to do on YouTube?"" And she's struggling with, ""Maybe I can open toys."" I'm just so over it. I just feel like I have to get back to basics. And it's harder with the 12-year-old because she's exposed to so much and she's faster than I am with these computer skills. So if I see something I don't like, she can hit two or three buttons and it's done. So I spend the rest of my time going, ""Go back to that page. Go back to that page. I know I saw it."" 
	I just feel like this whole social media, these influencer ... And I didn't even know what an influencer was before the pandemic. I had to learn all of this during the pandemic. And when they see these kids in these beautiful houses and their parents. The YouTubers where the twin girls or whoever, all I can do is watch it and say, ""Hey, their house is clean. You see they cleaned their room. Are you cleaning your room? They make their beds every day. Yes."" So these people are making tons and tons of money and they have all of these toys and these beautiful houses. Like one young lady said, the body imaging. I'm watching my 12-year-old constantly looking at her body and excited about it or say, ""Hey, I want my boobs bigger or maybe my butt should be bigger."" I'm so over it. 
	So even when this pandemic is over and these kids are back in school, this whole social media presence is here to stay. And I have to now navigate it so that I know what my kids are doing. And that whole SnapChat, I had to shut SnapChat down so quick because it's just too much. And the schools don't have SnapChat on their computers so I can say, ""Hey, no. We're not having it."" But the social media presence, I just have to stay on top of it. And with all that I have to do, I really don't want to be on social media like that but I have to. ",negative

Even though we're going through this pandemic, we were able to stay connected with our friends, our families. We can continue to do our work, whether it be schoolwork or our own adult work and just helped us be more creative about it.And for myself, my kids are pretty tech savvy, but for me, I feel like I wasn't. And I think this gave me an opportunity to really kind of expand on my small tech skills, so those were my three pros.And then, the cons were, yes, the endless playing of games. I'm just constantly finding myself, asking them to please try doing other things, read a book, take a break, something. But if I let them, there'll be on video games all day and it's been difficult to monitor also because, even though we have like a policy that everybody has to give up their devices at a certain time, they still found ways around it, you know? And the other thing is that I just find myself, it's just a point of contention now. We're just negotiating, constantly renegotiating and negotiating those things. Those were my cons.",positive
media_group,3,3,1,the ways technology has been useful during the pandemic and some of the ways it has been problematic during the pandemic.,3,"I can share. We have Similar issues. I have an 11 year old and a 16 year old. I would say, the overwhelming negative for everybody in the house is just way, way, way too much screen time and just really hard to... and I've never been good at managing the screen time. The only way I was ever able to do it was to just say like, ""No screen time during the week on a school night and screen time as much as you want on the weekends.""Now, because they need screens to do their homework, like trying to keep them from not, if you walk out of the room and you walk back in and like, they're playing my Minecraft or if not, it's on a hidden screen or whatever. You're like, oh, so my coping mechanism, of just saying all or nothing is kind of taken away now. Yeah, way too much screen time for everybody, me included.I'd say the biggest plus has been so many artists have found new ways of getting their art out to people, whether that's book illustrators or musical concerts. There's one band we would love to see become, maybe once a year, once every two years. And he's been doing a weekly concert every Saturday. That's a really nice thing that normally an artist we would only get to see once a year, we get to see every Saturday. And artists like Oliver Jeffers or Mo Willems or things like that, you know, doing really fun art related things has been fun.",negative
media_group,3,3,1,the ways technology has been useful during the pandemic and some of the ways it has been problematic during the pandemic.,2,"I can go. For the negatives on us, there's definitely been, it's the exact same thing just way too much screen time for everybody in the family, not just for the kids. You just kind of find yourself kind of, especially at certain points of the year when locked down was stricter, just bored. And so, all of us are on our phones or in front of the TV or on the computer.And my two are 14 and 10, so for the 14 year old, he's already kind of going through those teenage mood swings. And I have found that the extra screen time hasn't helped, like on days when he has less screen time, he's in a better mood overall. When he goes over a certain amount and he's just kind of a dick. And then, it's also been like disrupted sleep and trying to figure out what the best time to cut it off is so that they're not staying up too late and they're able to fall asleep without being all edgy.On the positives, both of my boys have ADHD and while they're both really smart, like getting them to focus in class has always been an issue. While they've been home and everything is laid out on the computer, their grades have skyrocketed, they're both currently on principal's list. Both of them have had nothing but nineties throughout the year. And I know a lot of parents have struggled with that transition to working from home.But for us, it actually worked really well because I was able to be like, ""Hey, let's put you in a quiet environment and there's no distractions at the moment and you sit there and I'll sit here and do my work and you sit there and you do yours. And if you need help, you let me know."" And because it's quiet and there's nothing else going around, they've been able to focus, so that's really been great for them as far as just grades.And then, the other one as a family that we've enjoyed is because we're not going out as much, the one time that I really do enjoy the screen time is when I'm like, ""Hey, let's do family movie night."" And our pod was us and then my mom and my aunt. We'd do like a whole thing.

And keeping in touch with, well, when the pandemic started, it seemed like we were making more of an effort to FaceTime with family in India, and have all the cousins together.And now, obviously a year into it, that's lessening a little bit. But in the beginning, there was this wanting to get together and actually FaceTiming people, which we hadn't done in a long time. And then, the negative is obviously the endless addiction that people have talked about, but also this concern that, are they going to be able to function as like normal humans like you and I function?

Sometimes, being in an ICT classroom is great for kids with ADHD, but sometimes it can be tricky because sometimes you have more disruptive kids in there and makes it a little harder for him to concentrate. On that aspect, it's been better. And my 11 year old had been given assistive technology, but had never really been shown how to use it. He didn't really use it at home at all.

I mean, the little one is in class starting in at 8:30. Really, we get them up and we start, they have Zoom classes certain times throughout the day. And then, during the rest of the day while he's not in Zoom classes, he has assignments that have to be completed and turned in preferably by 4:00. We'll get them up as early as 7:30 so he can start getting the work out of the way. And once he's done with that he's like, ""Hey, can I go watch this?"" Or, ""Hey, can I go play a video game?"" I'm like, ""How about you try to read for a half hour first and then, you know, give your brain a break from the computer?""

He starts at 9:00 and ends at 3:00. He's basically, with the exception of the lunch break that he gets, he's in front of the screen most of the day. And I think just like Parent 1 said, it kind of evolves from one thing to the next, because then even after school, he's still in front of the screen, whether it's doing homework, chatting with his friends or playing video games. I find myself having to come in and make him take breaks away from the screen, whether it's just go eat something or just go to the bathroom. I don't know because yeah, he'll just sit in there while my high schooler, his schedule is different. But I feel like he manages his time better because he has to go from his regular high school classes and his College Now classes. He has two different schedules to follow.

Our high schooler has kind of figured it out and manages his time well.

We haven't been able to do that with our current sixth grader. He's gotten a lot more screen time a lot more quickly. He got his first phone starting in sixth grade, but he certainly has much more access to screens than his brother did at the same age. All the sort of safeguards and things we had in place for our now 16 year old are out the window with the 11 year old.And he starts class at 9:00, but he'll get up at 7:30 in the morning to play Minecraft or Subnautica or whatever before school starts.

And so, there's been almost a full year now where they really haven't connected with kids in their own age. They just recently started going back to Taekwondo for in-person classes, so they're starting to see their peers and stuff, but I worry about their relationships and making friends.Especially for my oldest, he started, this was his first year of high school, so when he goes back in September, he'll be going into the 10th grade. But he was already going in without knowing anybody, so I worry that he will especially struggle to make those connections and know how to carry out conversations in person and how to hang out without a screen in their face.",negative

I know he's struggling with that at school. He goes to a boarding school, but they have the option to stay home and do Zoom also. And he actually, for the first time, he's very... He used to, well, he's always been very sociable, but this is his first year in high school, too, so he changed from schools, too. He went into a school where he knew nobody and then just half the school is actually there in person.And about a month ago, he asked to come home and I said to my husband, I go, ""This is the first time he's ever asked to come home. He's always loved being in a boarding student."" And I found that very strange. He wasn't talking to us very much. I found that he was isolating himself a lot, but he's going through that teenage period. You're like, ""Okay, is he just going through a phase?"" And it finally did come out that it was the social aspect of the school that he was just feeling very lonely and very isolated. And I think because everybody is on their screens everywhere and they're not socializing.

There's just no, there's just no way. And the worst is Discord. We've found discord to be incredibly problematic and really, really hard to monitor. And the tricky part about it is, it is, I think at least for my sons, it's like the main way kids were communicating with each other, because you can be on a group chat with your class with your advisory, with different things, so it has functional uses. You can't just say, ""No Discord,"" which is what I would like to do.But, having to constantly monitor all the different threads on Discord and trying to figure out Discord because I'm not a big social media user myself, so trying to figure out that stuff and what's okay to use and what's not.

The little one got a phone now because of everything going on. But Parent 2, Child 1, my oldest didn't get his phone until his his 14th birthday this past summer because it was like, well, we gave it to him as an early graduation gift because he was going to be going to high school and the high school was so much further from our home than where his middle school was.His middle school was a 15 minute walk from our place, the high school, he's actually going to, when he goes in, person is actually like a train ride and a bus ride away. At that point, we gave him the phone so he could get like phone numbers for all his friends that he wanted to stay in contact with from middle school and that kind of thing. But we had a strict no classic social media, no Facebook, no Instagram, no Snapchat, none of that.And we told the older one that when he got his phone, if he was interested in Instagram, because I felt like, okay, it's a little bit easier to monitor Instagram than it is some of the other social media you can get and he wasn't interested. But now, as this time has gone on, they've been interested in Discord and it actually started with group play on things like Roblox and stuff like that. That's how it started for them. But it is a lot harder to monitor. And the little one, not so much that he's 10, so there's a lot of YouTube, which I'm not crazy about, but at least I can sit in the room and kind of keep an eye on the YouTube with them and see what he's watching.But the Discord is really, really hard to keep track of and is kind of a concern for me because like, ""Who are you talking to? Who are you?"" You know what I mean? Like you're meeting all these people in these rooms and you're communicating and he's like, ""Oh, I made a friend and you know, wherever, and they're my age."" And I'm like, ""That stranger danger talk of internet stuff is like consistent."" Like, ""Hey, remember they're saying they're your age, but you're not seeing them in person. Anybody can say anything. You know? It's also, be careful about what you're putting out there. You know, just because somebody asks for X, Y, and Z doesn't mean you have to whatever.

And I feel like my younger son has had just way more access to social media in comparison to my older childs now with the pandemic and they're big video, big PlayStation gamers, so they have a lot more access than I'm comfortable with, but we've also had to go over the not giving out your personal information, not giving, putting your business out there with these people because you really don't know them.And also, just talking about just being caring, being careful, being cautious, not everybody's your friends type thing, but yeah, there's a lot of access with the YouTube, with the gaming. They're not on Facebook, thankfully, but they're on other things, they're on Instagram, they're on TikTok so it's just, I'm very concerned about the younger one because I feel like he's still trying to figure things out while at least the older one didn't, wasn't exposed to these things until more recently.

I'm already trying to push them more towards like so for like the summer I got my older one to apply to and enroll in two different activities. And they're both going to be Zoom, but it's Zoom with like people, you know what I mean? One is almost like a book group that he's gonna join. And the other one is a coding camp type of thing. And it means less time on things like Discord and stuff like that. I figure while it's not in-person, at least it's, it's interacting. It's more like this setup versus just typing in a chat room and being in front of the computer screen by yourself. And I've already been pushing him to do that now.I made him join a book group that he goes to twice a month and it's always like a fight because he's always like, ""Well, I'm just doing this on the computer."" And I'm like, ""No, shut it down and go join your Zoom.:"" I figure that if I'm having that much trouble with a 45 minute thing once a week, I can't imagine what it's going to be like when I'm like, ""Hey, go hang out with people."" Which is funny because like, when I was growing up, it was my mom going, ""Stop hanging out so much."" And now I'm like, ""Go outside, go meet someone, like take the train or something."" And I worry a little bit because it has engulfed him so much, he is so comfortable and settled in that I know it's going to be difficult to pull him away from that.I'm like, ""Do something, like you're not doing anything, you're sitting there watching somebody play a game."" It drives me crazy.And then, of course, they're like, ""Mom, you just don't understand."" And I'm like, ""You're right. I don't understand [crosstalk 00:52:07].""My 10 year old is here and he overheard that and he's just looking at me like... Get out of here, God away.He's like, ""It's just because it's fun."" I don't, I don't, put your earphones back on and watch your movie.One thing that we did for us that has been sort of working is at least one weekend day now that the weather is starting to warm up for the last two or three weekends, we've gone out for the day. And all they hate it. They hate it so much until they don't. But I'm like, ""Hey, we're going to go for a walk and we're going to go to this bookstore and we're going to maybe we'll grab lunch somewhere and let's go to the park. And even if we just sit on a bench and you know,"" and so for a few hours, depending on how long, this past weekend, we ended up staying out much longer than we expected. And we were all exhausted, but it also kind of felt so good because we were outside and not in front of a screen.And at first they were like, ""When are we going back? I was hoping to get on a game with my,"" and I'm like, ""I don't know. I don't know if we're going back anytime soon."" But it's helped.Yeah, I don't know. Like, I don't know if we're returning, it's never, we're never going back, but it kind of by the end of it, they were talking and, ""Oh, look at this and hey, you know, can we go here?"" And I was like, ""Yeah, absolutely. You want to go to Barnes & Noble? Yeah. I'll take you to Barnes & Noble. You want to look at a book? Sure."" You know? I'm like anything to like, keep you from being in front of a screen and to have you physically moving. And so, that helped.And I was like, ""Hey, maybe next weekend we can find someplace with like an easy hike, because like we're all like stiff and unused to moving and have like an extra 15, 20 pounds. Like all of us like from the littlest to the oldest, we're all just like round now."" And I'm like, ""Maybe we can start walking and get some of that roundness out."" And they're like, ""Yeah. Okay. I guess."" But at least I can get them to try it. They're not crazy about it, but they'll do it, so it gives us something that's not sitting in front of the screen.",negative

I give you a small example, like if it was my son's birthday, this is the younger one on Saturday. And I was like, ""Okay, so why don't we go out, go eat."" He loves hamburgers, so I said, ""Let's go, let's go to a burger place.""And he was like, ""No, I just want to stay home and play with my friends online."" And I was like, ""Oh, my God, that broke my heart."" I was like, ""Dude, we need to go outside, get some fresh air."" I had to force him just to take an hour outside, get some air, eat because like he's just breathing internet. I just feel like going back to school, that that transition is going to pretty intense, pretty difficult because they just want to be online all the time now.I agree. Right now, my son goes to school in person one day a week and I'm always grateful for that day. Not only is it a break for me because I don't have to be on edge and feel like I have to keep checking in to make sure he's on the right screen, not kind of being distracted by other things. But I think it makes, it forces him to kind of be around the other kids and talk. Because he really has no interest in doing that.I think back to when he was younger and getting speech services, how they'd always talk about things like pragmatics, that, that reciprocal conversation, the eye contact and like that's gone with all the devices and everything. It's something that kids are going to have to almost relearn once they're face to face, on a more consistent basis.",negative

It's very, very hard. You have to bribe them, trick them guilt them into it. It's a challenge. It's a constant challenge every day, trying to get them to be physical and go outside and look at the sun, sit out there and get some vitamin D. It's very hard.I think it will be a challenge. I know Parent 5, Child 1, I was kind of surprised, he actually verbalized, ""Mom, it's not the same talking to someone through social media as it is to talk to someone in person."" He knows it's not like a true human interaction. There's some kind of falsehood to it. A lot of pretend going and there's not as much work in that relationship through social media, as there is through a real face-to-face relationship with somebody.That was good that he actually is knowledgeable of that difference. How he'll interact and face-to-face is a big question because like I said before, he wanted to come home. I don't know whether the kids that he's socializing with are having the same issue, that nobody is socializing with them or is he having the issue, socializing with others? That's my question. Maybe it's a little bit of both from both sides.I have. I've asked about his friends, like who was he hanging out with? What do they do? What are their interests? Like I said, he just moved from the middle school to the high school, so all the kids are different. I mean, there was not one kid that's going to the same high school as he is. It's a whole new school to begin with, but everybody's starting in the ninth grade, so they're all coming from different areas of the country and going to that school.They're basically all in the same boat together, but it seems like social media did, has done something to, I don't know. It's very difficult for these kids to interact, to really interact. I go, ""What do you all do in the evenings?"" He's like, ""Oh, well, you know, like his roommate gets on the computer."" He's a big techie guy and Parent 5, Child 1 tries not to, but it does, it's really hard not to when everybody else is in their rooms doing something on their social media.",negative

He started a new school this year, middle school, and he was the only one from his elementary school to go to that middle school. And there were a number of students that have come sort of in large, larger groups from other schools, so there are kids that do know each other, even though everyone is starting sixth grade.But, and I do find that that's often used as a, I would say a point of manipulation if you try to limit Discord or screen time, like, ""Those are my only friends, it's the only contact I have with people and you want to take it away from me."" And, and there's, I've done a lot of defensiveness around any kind of discussion that the internet may not be God given gift to humanity.We tried to watch a movie about, or there was a TV, like a 20/20 or 60 minutes or something about like screen time in America. And I was like, ""Well, why don't we watch this together? And you guys can tell me what you think."" And they're like, ""Oh, you just want to take away our screen time."" They were just like, wouldn't hear it, wouldn't even listen to it. Totally, this was like, ""You're old, you just don't get it."" And how important it is to us.""I'm so sick of it. They're days I leave my phone by accident and I'm like, ""Oh, it's so nice, like, this is what it used to be like and no one could reach you.""Well, what's interesting is I'm just now reading The Scaffold Effect, I was recommended because right. You guys were sending that out. And it's on the chapter on like screen use and it's like, ""Kids should only be you know, using the screens two hours a day,"" and I'm like, ""Okay, Mr. Koplewicz, that's not happening."" I'm like, ""Who is managing two hours a day?""I know, I know. Every time that like your average daily screen use, I'm like, I don't want to see it. I don't want to see it. I don't want to see my kids. I just, I don't need to see they're all averaging like 10 hours a dayI have to say I'm looking forward to them going back to school full-time. Just because I think that will naturally on its own decrease the screen time. As long as they were not just Zooming in class, which is so frustrating. But yeah, I'm definitely looking forward to them going back.Yeah, I mean, I think so many of the kids with the IEPs, all those services are just out the window. I mean, my son had his first year after years and years of trying to get them OT finally got it. And then, it was cut off last March and nothing since then. He was supposed to be an ICT class, that's not happening. And that's the other part is being in a position of being parent, teacher, screen monitor. It has not been good for our relationship. Having to sit there in his, and do my work in the same room that he's in, because if I walk out, he's not, he doesn't know what's going on in class. He doesn't, so I have to stay in the same room to make sure that he's at least in the Zoom classroom of the class that he's in.And so, like any independence that he would have gained this year has just gone. And now that he is going back hybrid, like when he's in school, nothing gets done. They've tried to do it so all work gets done during the school day and they don't have extra homework after school. But they said he's in school now, nothing gets done because he just, he doesn't have somebody sitting there again, ""Are you in the class? Are you on the right Zoom? Are you opening the right files?""Complete learned helplessness at home, which is entirely my fault, but I don't, I haven't managed to figure out that bridge of making sure he gets the information and understands what's going on, but is independent and can do stuff on his own. We decided on making sure he knows the information so that if they have to build on that information next year, but yeah, the independence, non-existent.",positive

And I feel they did a wonderful job and at least the kids were able to continue learning.
	But as we came to this year and she transferred to Tottenville, it's honestly ridiculous the way they're doing it because you are either at home or you could do blended. And blended a Tottenville means you go sit in a classroom with your computer, just like you're at home because all the teachers are at home, and the kids are in school. So they sit there with their headsets. I don't know what story is there with teachers, and I love teachers but I'm so fed up, they don't want to go back. And they're learning nothing. My daughter... I feel this year has been a complete wash. She was an 85 to 90 student now she barely passes a class, because she just has no motivation. On top of that she had major knee surgery two months ago, which that I guess made it good because she still could do the work, but I don't feel they're really learning anything. Sea did, Tottenville had to learn how to do it, which I guess they did between last year for them was a total waste because there were kids who just didn't know what they were doing. This year they know what they're doing. But it's just, number one it's either the teachers keep too long in the class or not long enough. And some of the work is just so ridiculous that they have to do and sometimes it's a lot. And sometimes it's just, I don't know, it's different because they're doing classwork and homework at home.

Similarly, to some of the things that Parent 2 said, although we've had a different experience both my kids had been using collaborative online platforms before the pandemic, which always seemed to be of benefit to the way that it was operating.
	And, obviously there's the benefit that this had to happen in terms of any kind of continuity. But in both cases, I think the meaningfulness of it, or any kind of robust engagement with education has really diminished. My 15 year old had a complete depressive breakdown last year, and including with hospitalizations for depressive incidents, is now at a therapeutic boarding school where at least he's there in person. So we had to have something very dramatic happen through all of that. I think that these things were underlying before but I think the circumstances around a pandemic exacerbated and accelerated this and it was certainly not helped by the pivoting to completely remote. His school, Brooklyn Tech, was just too big I think to be able to handle it meaningfully at all and so that that was a big thing there for us. 
	And then my middle schooler, my 12 year old is really struggling, again it makes such a difference when he's able to be in person, his school is now gone to three days in person out of a six day cycle. It hasn't been able to be consistently implemented because of different cases and having to shut down from time to time. But when he's there in person, they're teaching in person, and he's a different kid. And now they hadn't been doing fully asynchronous learning before going to that platform, they had been teaching classes on Zoom. So now, you see those three days, I'll take it because I see what happens when he's there in person. But the asynchronous stuff is really not useful. It's very rote, package assignments that they dial in, it's not engaging and I would agree I think he's regressed over this year.",negative

Since Corona has technology been used for educational purposes? How do you find it beneficial?

	I was a little bit upset about that, they were depressed and ""oh my god, I'm not going to get it done right."" And they weren't and to my knowledge the teachers weren't even uploading the material correctly. So they weren't getting a lot. They lost out a lot last year in terms of education really, nonetheless, they didn't have in person classroom. We started With just remote, then we did blended learning that was like not really.And they don't know how to do their own work, upload it, they're using Calendars which is important for day to day personal progression.
	The little one lost out most of all, she was in Pre-K. Very tough. I'm still working full time. I have to sit by her side while I'm working, while I have a call. And it was tough for her because she didn't know how to turn on the laptop, she didn't know how to upload her work, she still doesn't know how to upload her work it's hard to leave that responsibility up to a little kid that's four or five. 
	In comparison to this year, I can say it's like 70% better than last year because I think that the public education is a lot more prepared than last year in terms of trying to keep up the par with the classes, more on schedule versus links that are broken and not working. They're a little bit more lenient With the kids getting their work in on time, they enable them to do better by giving them small group sessions via Zoom. And that's great because for example all my girls, all four of them, they're fully into going to school in person.
	And I could say the difference between that and before is just in general my kids were like, ""I don't want to go in and what we going to do and they're still zooming."" [inaudible 00:23:22] But they came home and they were so excited just to see other kids or their teachers and their peers and stuff. So just seeing that made a difference made them want to honestly go back to school in person there are teachers they to tell you, ""hey, why don't you have a pen?"" Or, ""do you need extra help?"" It's better when they're in person, there is a difference.",negative
media_group,3,4,1,speak a little bit about if technology was used for educational purposes before the pandemic? And did you find that beneficial? Did you have any concerns before the pandemic? Since Corona has technology been used for educational purposes? How do you find it beneficial? And have you had any concerns on the technology side of things? ,4,"Yes, hi. I will start with my youngest he had a really difficult time adjusting as did everyone. But more difficult than my other two kids of a similar age. And he's just returning maybe three weeks ago to a month ago, he's just returning to school. They started out two days Monday and Tuesday and now they just set up to... He was struggling as far as not being able to meet with his other classmates and teachers.Yes, for the full week they just started although this was their first week back last week. I think Wednesday they had a flood so then they didn't finish the week off. So they had to do Zoom classes Thursday and Friday and they're going to go back tomorrow. They're starting a full week so they're going to go back Tuesday.
	But it seems like they had a lot of filler rather than content as far as learning and one of the parents at the school had even text in to the other parents saying, ""Do you think that the school seems to be falling off?"" Because of the way they were teaching, I don't know why it went there, but they did a lot of videos more than learning things they were doing videos and dancing and things when you check in to see what they're actually doing at home on the Zoom classes. But he's back now and it seems there's a difference even in what he's learning.
	But he was also dealing with I think Zoom burnout because he would tell me, ""I'm sick of going on Zoom, I want to go to school, I want to see my teachers, I want to see my friends."" And so it hit him very, very hard. My daughter, she's 15 she was in a gifted program and she was just really let down and saying that she worked so hard and now everything she worked for was kind of just falling through, she felt. And she's also just resuming going to school she goes three days out of the week. And it seems to have a better impact on her actually being there because she was in the house and she's home and doing Zoom. She does the Zoom but then once Zoom is over, all three of them they all just want to be in their rooms. They don't want to come out. I have to try to engage them and take them places and do things with them so that they will come out of their rooms. They just want to be in the room.
	And my 17 year old, he I would say was doing better with the Zoom at home than at school because, I don't know, he just had issues of attending all his classes. But I still have to be on him at home because even though he's at home, and he's right there sitting at the desk, there are times when he can find other things to do on the computer and not be in the class and he's telling me he's in the classes and I'm checking, ""I'm there, I'm there."" And then teachers are calling me telling me, ""Oh, he's not in the class."" So it's been kind of a struggle but he's doing better than he was physically at school.",positive
media_group,3,4,2,"what was your experience with technology for education before the pandemic and how has that changed and concern, benefits?",1,"Well again I have two children one is 10 and the other one is seven. So 5th grade and 1st grade. So first off my older one didn't really use the computer that often before the pandemic but he likes using technology. So somehow he was happy when it did happen, going remote, and the one thing I like and again my son, the older one has an IEP, he helped me out.
	So to have a better idea about what was being done at school and how he was doing it. So I was more on top in being a to assist him. The draw back is that sometimes the teachers would make comments and tell him you didn't do this right but there was no follow up because one teacher was teaching remotely, the other one was doing in person. So I would say it did affect him because he was not getting the support he used to. So finally when they were able to go to blended learning he was fine with it but when he, two or three weeks ago, had to go full day, five days a week, he wanted to go fully remote because I think that he's started to be challenged. He has a hard time with writing so he felt overwhelmed and that's why he wanted to back off a little bit and go fully remote because he thought it was easier.
	And my younger one, again I had to be next to him to connect him to all the meetings and printing the documents and so he had a lack of motivation somehow. I mean he would listen to his classes but getting him to do the work, the assignments, was sometimes challenging. And it's the same this week he started going back five days and it's hard to get him in, he became a homey person.",positive
media_group,3,4,2,"what was your experience with technology for education before the pandemic and how has that changed and concern, benefits?",5,"I would say I would love to see most of these tools go out the window for a while as we go back. I'd really love to be able to see them start to work collaboratively and engage as people in person. Obviously we will still have those supports of the technology but I hope that we can start to use it as support tools and not the over-reliance on them that we've had. And I understand that I said the other day to be able to have something that is more functional and he was saying and the rote stuff. 
	While some of the others were talking I think the thing for my 12 year old he's happier when he's there in person, but to move from that but shift it's so easy for him to now just slump all day long. And because it's all on the one platform or the one tool and when I'm working all day long and can't be checking up on him rather than going down and doing the same thing. It all just become this one little suck and it is very easy for him to be distracted and to switch to surfing the internet, or watching a video, or playing a game. So, I would just really to be able to move to actual instruction.",positive
media_group,3,4,2,"what was your experience with technology for education before the pandemic and how has that changed and concern, benefits?",3,"I think I would to see technologies stay and if it will be mandatory, it should be blended. Technology should always be there as a part of the world and the way we move each day, and it should be mandatory and implemented within the school system and they should learn how to use it day one when they go in. They should know how to turn on the laptop or upload something, the key things, the main stuff, which they weren't taught. They should have enacted force and I don't think they did. So they use these things and they don't know how and they don't fully know how to do everythingNo, it was here you go, this is it. Maybe they sent a video. I don't know, something.",negative
media_group,3,4,3,challenges you anticipate in going back or parts of technologies you'd like to see stay or go?,2,"I guess I anticipate a lot of anxiety, my daughter she struggles with anxiety. Parent 2, Child 1 is my youngest. That's what I'm talking because everybody else seems to have younger kids. So she is already getting so nervous about having to go back. Meanwhile, she's not doing what she used to do because she said it almost becomes you feel schoolwork is optional. I mean because she's on the older end so it obviously is different than with the little ones and she's really getting so nervous. And she's dying to go back because she rarely sees any friends or I do believe all the kids from the younger ages they should start teaching, they should have the technology because that was the good thing about Sea is that they had a program, because they didn't do snow-days. So they had it totally set up so it was not such a big deal going remote. 
	But even with my other children my 18 year old started he graduated in last June so he started CSI and he ended up dropping out. He did first semester he did okay he struggles with anxiety a bit too and OCD, so I had talks with him, ""you can't drop out"" because now he withdrew too late that we have to pay now for the semester that he didn't do but he just couldn't do it, he was going nuts. My other son, thank God he goes to a Dayhab where it's very small so he's still going. 
	And my other daughter she goes to Dalton. She's in her third year. She's very smart but she's neurotic, her grades are so good it's ridiculous. So good, and she's still doing very well, but she doesn't like it either. Right now she does two labs in person so it's two classes a week. I don't know, but naturally she's going out now a bit there and socially. I don't even know there's just so many, this whole thing has just been very not good all around. It doesn't help anyone, I know we have to worry about the getting but... we all actually had the virus in January. But anyway.It doesn't help anyone, I know we have to worry about the getting but... we all actually had the virus in January. But anyway.Yeah, it's been so long. Next year she'll be a Junior, Parent 2, Child 1, and she's never ever been in the school. I mean she's been there with my other children but she's never been taught in that school. So, she's anxious about that too.",positive

And now during the pandemic, how are your kids using media and TV and do you have any concerns or have you seen any benefits from media and TV?",3,"Like I say my kids before the pandemic, didn't really watch TV or any news or anything like that.
	A lot of the times they will watch Netflix, or they go on social media or like this TikTok thing and stuff like that. So whatever they hear is from on there, or from friends, and group chats. Other than that, they don't really watch the news so they don't really know of what's going on there unless there's a discussion about it within the house or they hear something from the social media. For really they're just singing and dancing so I can't say that it's really affecting them in that way, they just know that they're in the house and not really going anywhere because of this pandemic, that's all they know.No, I can't say that it has.Well for us now I mean only because now the weather's getting nicer I don't have the issue with them watching as much, TV or whether they're playing videos or watching TV and stuff. Because the weather is nicer, they're more active. Three of the girls are closer in age and they hang out together, they'll go bike riding, we have a pool they'll go swimming. They'll interact with each other where they're not watching the TV and they don't want to know what's going on because they're just together around each other, and they're still younger, they're not wanting to go out and party and all this and that. Well, I don't have that issue yet.",positive

My youngest son, he was more a outdoors person, and now he's just like, I have to tell him you can't watch TV so that he isn't on there 24/7, because he would be if he if you didn't tell him. He's on YouTube and videos, anything he could go 24/7 just in front of the TV.
	My oldest son 17 year old. He has set up video games on each floor, in his bedroom, in the attic and on the first floor. Just so that he can have, if his brother is in the room with him then he'll go downstairs and hook up with the video game. He just has it set up so that he can be on any video games, almost like 24/7 if not that videos. My daughter she's in her room on her TV, and I don't know they have some kind of way they have video games on the TV where she's here and they're jumping around Dance Revolution-ing. But she's more into the news so she will come and tell me, ""Mom, did you hear this?"" I mean she's always engaged in what's going on. She will come and tell me that but I think they're just a little bit too much into the TV since they've been shut in. Yeah, too much, too much. I have to get them to do things so that they're not around the clock on it.It's a positive thing it's not really overwhelming. It's not overwhelming or depressing her or anything but she just lets me know that she knows what's going on asking me do I know, constantly updated.I'll just say, I just think the weather definitely has an impact. We had the first warm day and I mean it was really nice that day my son got up.
	He's the outdoor guy. He got up he got on the scooter, he left and went around the block, on his scooter, masked up and went around the block and came back home. That following day, it was cold so I just assume that he thought that it was gonna be beautiful that day he went out in his t-shirt. I mean he actually went around the block thinking I guess, ""it's going to be nice so I'll go a little farther."" But he came back and he was freezing because he just can't wait to get out because we've been chatting for so long now. But I think a weather will definitely have impact on everybody because they want they all want to be outside.My oldest son he goes out and walks around the block every day.

	Again what I was controlling before the pandemic was more their screen time. And what my older one, the 10 year old, does is more like Minecraft and their group chat was just with their friends and again I went from controlling one hour a day to now it's unlimited time. Because he has a harder time entertaining himself and then with a few parents, we were like okay they're playing Minecraft which is not too bad, it's not our favorite but it was constructive, and they were between their friends. But sometimes he goes out of control and it started to be the main focus of my son's life. If he wakes up he would just go to his computer so I tried to give him more freedom but at the same time I realized that it has to have its limits.
	And my younger one who's seven, somehow he's not watching too much TV but he I noticed that he went from educational program to now any type of cartoons. But I would say depends on the personality but he entertains himself more like he's more crafty and I realize sometimes he will point out that his brother is too much on the screen, and the reason why I gave a bit limited time is because it was creating a lot of struggles in the house and I think we all have enough stress around us.",negative

Yeah we also have had real issues with the time where we had been able to exercise certain amount of discipline on screen time before and it just go thrown out the window.
	Certainly when my 15 year old, last year it became the whole night and day got completely switched. She was spending a lot of time, like either chatting online all night or watching movies or YouTube videos, stuff like that and that got things pretty out of whack. That obviously is being addressed because he's in an environment now where he doesn't have access to that. 
	And with the 12 year old, like still it's a struggle because he uses an iPad for school and he's always trying to switch off to watch a video. Sometimes he's playing the Nintendo Switch while he's watching a video, both things while he's supposed to be in school. Constantly having to go in and monitor that and take things away but during the day, I kept moving the switch out of the way that's what he's got. And a little bit of social media, I think with Minecraft and with friends, that's been a lot of the only way he's kept engaged with people that he knows, his friends and they're chatting that way on their Minecraft or some other video game.
	And both kids I don't think they consume in terms of TV per se, like again we have Netflix and stuff and NPR is always on in the background so I think they seem to be akin to what's happening in the world around. And surprisingly, sometimes I feel like 12 year old is maybe more aware of it than I think, he does ask questions about it. School seems to be pretty good at keeping discussions going on with current events. So, keep that I guess. I'd like us to be able to exercise more balance really. I feel like I'm half the time I'm shouting into the wind over it so to work with him particularly to have healthier balance.",negative

I do think that definitely watching more TV, but once again like Netflix, things like that and actually with my daughters it's been kind of nice because we went on binge fests of Supernatural and all these other kind of shows. So we spend more time together and have something to talk about that relates to use all.But that is something that I think, I don't know if it's Parent 5 had said about, the online and stuff my 18 year old son last year... because I think she's the one who had to go to the boarding school, whoever that was, my son who was watching these videos that he began to think he was cursed from watching these videos. And we were very close to having to send him somewhere because it's almost like he became suicidal, he became so obsessed, he couldn't eat, drink, sleep, about being cursed by, he saw like these doll things, I don't even know what it was but it was something. He's always had issues but it really, so then he wasn't allowed to go on the computer, do any of that stuff but he's crazy with the video games, he plays mostly basketball and stuff which I guess is, better. But anyway that's my story.I mean I would say the same with the Summer coming we did our yard last year, we have a nice big pool. Last Summer was really nice with that and the kids, so they're looking forward to that and definitely the rebalancing of time indoors versus outdoors so it'll be, I think good.

So for me, they were a very big distraction before the pandemic, and it's a far worse distraction now to the point that I feel, and I've shared this with other parents, that kids can easily switch from one screen to the other and they're easily distracted. And unless you're there behind them, they can be on Instagram and whatnot all day basically. And because they hear the teacher speak, they know when to switch back. So I think the distraction was always there but they were not distracted in class so to speak, unless they were allowed to use their phones, which they don't, unless they cheat but it's been not good. I think the distraction has been detrimental to their learning this whole year. So yes, it's a great resource, they can learn anything, they can find anything.

And I think a big part of how each of them have responded to the technology aspect has a lot to do with the structure of the school. So my son who's in Monsignor Farrell who, he is the one who completed the Healthy Brain Network assessment, his school makes you stay on video, in uniform, they take attendance every class, they continue to watch you and see what you're doing and comment the same way they would as if you were in school. So if you are dosing off, if you're not looking at the camera, if it looks like you're looking down in your lap, they'll say something to you to address it.

My other two who are in charter schools, you might as well teaching to a bowl of jello because they are 100% having conversations on every social media platform, playing Roblox, planning the rest of their day.

So you can Google that Christopher Columbus sailed in 1492 which we had to painstakingly remember. But now, they're going to have you really think about why did he do that, what was the significance of it.

But I think the social aspect sort of distracted him a lot, and he felt different than everybody, and I think now having the opportunity to do this from home has made him less anxious about everything else and able to then focus more on the work.

Because at least then as opposed to just sitting with the video game on the screen by themselves and looking at it all day, they were laughing and playing and yelling and getting excited because there really was no alternative at that point in time.

And since then as things have opened back up, we've gone back to having more conversations about when we have a choice, you always choose the in-person activity to get some fresh air.

Smartboards, and things like that at school aside, because obviously those are technology and I think they're positive. She literally... 
	Our school went to complete Zoom, like most did... although we went faster than I know some districts did. On Friday school was closed and on Monday school was on Zoom. They the whole time had run it the full day, just exactly like it would be in school, which I know increases the Zoom fatigue, but for her... She shut down. She stopped doing any work. She stopped doing anything. She would sign in to her Zooms, but it was like she wasn't even there. She would have other screens open and other devices open. She'd be on Buzzfeed or something else. She would show up to extracurriculars that were on Zoom, but she'd do the same thing. She was not present. She wasn't present in our family. She wasn't present in anything.

I put... all my answers, I put both positive and negative. That was before Covid. Technology overall allows him to be exposed to things before they're mature enough to handle, anyways. That's a negative. Everything I see has positives and negatives. 
	Once Covid started... He has ADHD, so being in the classroom with the other kids was an automatic distraction. The teachers were always, ""He can't pay attention. He can't sit still."" It was always something. 
	Learning at home, I was able to... That first semester, last spring, I was able to sit right next to him. Oh, okay. We're going to work. I'm the power, you know? I was able to show him better habits of learning and work, which he was more independent this past fall. He did better with the computer. I think being out of the classroom and at home cut some of the distractions. He was able to focus a bit better to see exactly what was impeding his progress in the classroom, and what wasn't. That was a positive. 
	I think the entertainment systems, like the Xbox and... The Xbox was just entertainment, because you can't go outside. It was a form of entertainment for him.

Right before Covid started he was doing... it would have been his second semester of his freshman year. He started having bad anxiety, he sometimes gets... in front of people he gets a lot of anxiety... around new situations... He didn't want to finish school. He wanted to take a semester break. He had a thing about being in front of people he didn't know, and not knowing what he was capable of. So he took a break. 
	Then in the fall, when it switched to... the only choice was remote, or online learning, he's like, ""Okay, I'll give it a shot."" He actually was very successful. He did really well. The teachers were... He also only took three classes instead of four or five, to make it easier. The teachers were accommodating, and he was able to go at his own pace. It was better because he didn't even have to... they don't have to show their faces on Zoom. He got a good, positive, outcome. He actually went back again this spring, and he's doing really well. That's where I think, in his case, it was positive to have class online. 
	I would completely disagree for my other two kids in high school. Absolutely not. They take advantage of being at home and having their devices. But anyway... The positive for Parent 4, Child 1 was that he could actually go back to school and not have to feel intimidated or anxious around other people. 
	The other positive for him is, in between this, he also got a job through DoorDash, and now Uber Eats, where he is driving part time. Again, doesn't have to really socialize with too much people. A lot of people just have the drop off deliveries. Enough where he's feeling more comfortable when he grabs the food, or says thank you. It's helped him a lot, and the technology is how he takes the orders. It's all through the phone. He has to correspond through the phone, and if he has difficulties he has to go through their help desk online. It's really helped him become very independent, and very self-sufficient. He's grown tremendously in terms of his self esteem, just doing these two things and having the ability to do that just in the last six months.

In 2019/2018 we were both overwhelmed with all the papers that the school were giving and sending home. It was just overwhelming to even look at it. Now that everything is organized on the computer that he has from school, it's just a click away. It's either multiple choice, or fill-in, and he gets it done. 
	Now he's in high school and I feel that I can help him more. Meaning at the end of the quarter I can see what he's missing, and I can, myself, tell him, ""Parent 1, Child 1, get this done. You're missing this, this, and this."" I can sit next to him and watch him get it done, and check up on him. Also, I communicate regularly with his teachers to make sure that he'll pass on to the 10th grade. 
	In the 5th grade, he got left back. Yes, because it was just too much. Too much paper. Too much everything. Too overwhelming. In class, he would fall asleep. Here he has no choice. I'm here. I'm home. I'm going to be barging in his room like, ""What are you doing?"" I can check up on him. 
	I also feel like he likes it more. He doesn't... he has not complained at all about him wanting to go back to school. I do have him in hybrid, where he goes twice a week, which is good. He needs to get moving. He's a little bit husky. That's a negative that I find in not going to school. Not being able to mobilize and get your steps in.

It bothers me, because now he'd on his PlayStation all the time. All the time. Now you hear him... he's talked to his friends only virtually, never physically, which I believe is important. 
	That's pretty much it. It's hard to get him out of the house too, on a regular day basis. I try to take him to the gym, or take him outside to get some sun. His vitamin D is very low. It just scares me sometimes. I don't know. It's hard to also make him take a vitamin D pill. Those are my concerns. His health, socializing... I don't want him to have anxiety when he's back in the public and everybody's back in school. The rush... the rat race, the trains, the bus. He takes the bus, by himself, to school.

Despite that, she's concerned because more kids keep coming back. First of all, I think they need to learn to be social in the manner that they were before. I think they've lost that skill. They have to re-find their comfort and figure that out. 
	I also think there's definitely an underlining sense of fear, or nerves, depending on the kid. For a kid like mine, it's fear. Some are just nervous about interacting in a close physical space even though there are masks, and some people are being tested and everything. An extra kid showed up in Math and they put all the seating closer together. Everybody in the Math class was so uneasy. Teacher and kids. They felt too close to each other because now they have this whole mentality that that's potentially dangerous. That's not going to go away in a minute. Next year they're all going to be back in school, and they're going to be closer together. They have to figure out how to navigate all that again, which I think is a definite challenge",negative

	The older one that I was talking about that has the anxiety... They all have different forms, but the one who is worried about going back to school in the fall and not even sure if he wants to go back. I don't think it's because of the programming. I think it's because of the social component. He went to a smaller out-of-district private school. He knew everybody there. He felt popular. He felt comfortable being around people. Put him in a bigger environment... he's very nervous about that. 
	I've been trying to reassure him that now that he's selected his major, and he only has major courses left, it's going to be the same people he knows. He's starting to see that. They did have to go in yesterday, and they had to go in a couple weeks ago... It's a photography major. He even came home and felt comfortable because he had met some of the people in person. He's like, ""These people, some of them have all four classes with me this semester."" He's finding that some of them are probably going to take the same classes in the fall because they're only offered in the fall... certain ones.
	I'm hoping I can coax/urge him, encourage him to go, but I do see he keeps putting it off. He's like, ""I don't know. I'm not really sure. I haven't decided what I want to do yet."" He's 20. You want to have him make his own choices as an adult, but yet he's an immature 20 year old, an inexperienced 20 year old.

He's not going remote learning, but he does use his technology. He already has a tablet. He already knows how to work everybody's phone. FaceTime. All of that. With him alone we used to get up, ""Let's watch channel 13, Sesame Street,"" educational programs, stuff like that. He's like, ""No."" He needs his tablet to do his homework, is what he tells us. He needs his tablet to do his homework. What he's doing is mimicking everybody else, because he sees everybody else with a device, and doing something on the device. 
	My daughter, she's 10. She goes to [Success Academy 00:33:15], but she's been doing remote learning the longest. Success Academy were one of the first charters to go remote, even before the Mayor and everybody else was going to do the remote thing. They stopped the kids from coming in. They already had them going remote. My daughter's 10 and she's being doing remote learning for about a year and a half now. 
	I feel like it's counter productive, because I have to obsessively stay on her back. Where they give the kids a itinerary that they want... like when you go to college, you get your course itinerary. You got to go on. You got to be responsible for doing your assignments and turning them in on time. Stuff like that. That's how they're running the program. I feel like for self starters... for kids who are on the ball and you can give them directions and they can go follow them without anything... it's good for those types of kids. If your kid guides off for five minutes or gets side tracked, it's counter productive because you got to stay on they back.

That was definitely a huge adjustment. They definitely weren't able to attend as well as far as school. Their screen usage rally picked up. It was because now they had a screen. My kids, before then, didn't have access to screens in such a capacity. I don't have that many screens in my house. I only have one TV. Only two of my kids have phones. 
	There wasn't this intense access and awareness of what they could be doing on a screen until Zoom started. Zoom was incredibly difficult for all of them to keep up, to study, to learn, to know. They didn't know what was flying. Like the mother that just spoke said, I had to be on top of everybody's Zoom. It's six kids. It was impossible for me to remote work when I was supposed to be working. 
	This year my kids are all in school. They go to private school. They're all in school. Save for a few quarantines that they had to go through, the school did go on Zoom for a short while. The goal waS to get the kids back in the classroom. The screen situation didn't really get much better. They feel more comfortable communicating on a screen, now, with their friends. They need to FaceTime. They need to Zoom. They actually Zoom in groups with their friends now. If they study they can't study on their own. [crosstalk 00:38:12] ROBLOX.
	My 11 year old is definitely by far the hardest of all of them. She went from being on a computer and being a watcher to becoming... ROBLOX is the thing that she wants to do all the time. She'll grab my phone and say, ""I want to text my friends"", but inevitably she ends up doing a gaming. I hate it. Then she says she's gaming with her friends. She'll game and then FaceTime at the same time. No one else plays ROBLOX but her. I don't allow her to direct message anybody or accept anybody's messages on ROBLOX. That became a huge... it's a battle. There's no saving from that. I don't allow social media for my kids. It just... everyday.
	There came a point a few weeks ago I actually removed all the computers from my house, because they don't need to be on Zoom. They're not on Zoom... My 11 year old has to deal with it. I don't like... I literally took... We had three laptops, I sent them to my husband's office. I said keep them there.

When we gave him the phone, our cell phone carrier has an app that we have on our phones so that we can control what he can access. We still have that in place. It has a bedtime on it when you can't access the internet. You can shut down sites one by one where he can't access. We've still had to do that.

I believe her name was miss Parent 6, that spoke after me. When she mentioned her 11 year old and the ROBLOX... Oh my goodness. Before Covid, social media for my daughter was a reward. Like, ""Oh mommy, I finished doing whatever I have to do. I took care of my responsibilities. Can I use the phone now?"" I would give her the phone, and she would be able to, ""Can I make a TikTok? Can I do this, can I do that?""
	Now, because you have to have a device consistently, to me, it slightly took away a piece of my control level. Now you're on the screen all the time, you can just click and I don't see. I don't see what you're clicking. I don't see what you doing. I don't see what you looking at. I don't see what you watch, because I'm under the presumption that she's sitting at your thing and you're doing your work. You're looking at the screen because you supposed to be doing your work, your homework, your this or your that... but you could be looking at the screen and guiding off. There's been a couple times she was in class guiding off, and the teacher's now texting me, ""We're doing math and [Genesis 00:43:55] is trying to get on Instagram."" 
	I feel like it changed the dynamic of what they're doing. Like, what do you mean? I need the phone. I need to be on this, and I got to be on that. I got to check this now. I'm like, none of that is important. What's important is did you do your work? Did you check your work? Did you submit your work? After you've done that, you can have free time to do what you want on the phone. You want to play ROBLOX... they even incorporated that in school. 
	In school there used to be a little time for them to get a reward, or maybe to play a game, something like that so they could interact with each other. Now they got it on the phone. Now they got ROBLOX club. They got this, and they got that. Now when they give the kids the 20 minutes-30 minutes of free time where the kids could be inter... even though we're on Zoom... I could've done a class, or play a math game. They do that once in a while. 
	Now everybody's in a breakout room, and you guys got 30 minutes to play ROBLOX together. I feel like it's taken over. [crosstalk 00:45:23] I feel like there's no separation between the time to what you supposed to be doing certain things",negative

We all grew up without phones so we understand what it is to be home, and not necessarily have to communicate to the world every little thing we're doing. Every little thing that we're eating. They find this intense pressure to be on all the time. All the time they have to have something relevant, something that's cool, something they're eating, something they're showing, a selfie. I find it endless. 
	It definitely became worse now, because during Zoom they were spending all that time in their room. Now they're still spending all that time in their room. I'm like, can you come up? My two oldest girls, their rooms in the basement. I'm like, ""I need you to come upstairs. Come out of your room, and put your phones down."" 
	I actually started a new policy with them that they need to charge their phones in the kitchen because they're not sleeping. Even with all this screen time boundaries that I put on them, somehow they manage to do something or other. One of my daughters actually... I'm Sabbath observant, so we don't use phones Friday night to Saturday night. We do not touch our phones. We don't turn on our phones. We don't use electric. We don't use television. We don't use anything. It's actually the biggest blessing in the world because it's a religious requirement. We're bound. We don't do it. It's something that... We all are able to release our phones because it's from birth. I don't use my phone on Friday night and Saturday. I find that on those nights, there's so much more... There's just so calm. You can see there's less pressure on them to have to connect. We never connected like this with society when we were kids. We run home we did our homework. We could barely get the phone because our sister was on the phone. 
	[crosstalk 00:49:24] that negative where we couldn't use the phone. There's lot of battle. It's a lot of battle.

At some point, it entertains them instead of me having to entertain them, especially during the beginning of Covid when they couldn't be with their friends. Right?
	My neighbor kept making fun of me for how much time I was spending outside playing basketball, doing relay races, collecting golf balls, and doing other things to keep him busy and off his devices. At some point, I have work, I have dishes to wash, I need five minutes not entertaining anyone, so okay, you can use it a little bit more. Then there are those ridiculous streaks that they have on some of these things. Where they have to and a message on Snapchat every day not to break the streak. He'll sit there just on streaks. This is my... the one who uses devices less, watches the Simpsons while he walks up and down the steps, and then has to get on social media to talk to his friends about a particularly funny part.

I think he overuses it and it's affecting his sleeping. He sleeps in, then he goes to sleep too late. He's 20, I don't know how much I want to be constantly taking his phone from him. I do try to put restrictions in terms of, you have to get up by a certain time and if you stay up late that's going to be a problem. I can't tell him how and when to sleep, but I can make him get up and be productive in the morning as much as possible, including giving him a couple morning classes when it's time to help them sign up.

And dinner, just like what's your name?

My 15 year old, my oldest, she was struggling with it and we call her in her cave, like you need to get out of your cave, you need to get out of your cave. The good thing is we started watching some TV shows at night making every like certain nights of the week we'll watch something together as a family and at least we get to socialize with them, because if not, I forget that she's even home sometimes.
	I don't even know she's there because she does not leave her room. Socialization has been a tremendous thing. My boys are in junior high, they finally went back full-time and yes, I sent them back full-time because I couldn't wait for them to go back, remote didn't work for them. And being a stay at home mom, being a working full-time at... is not the most convenient thing with three children. I became dependent on the Internet, like, ""Just take your iPad, go do something on your iPad."" My little one, I was doing work at 11:00 at night with him and I was telling the teachers, ""You can't mark him late, I work all day, I work after school jobs and I'm on the computer all day, I can't maintain him and he has an IEP with needs and they're not being met."" 
	He would get work done at 11:30 at night, so bedtime was a joke. It was like he could sleep all day because he's out of my hair. And his academics, we'll do at night with him. And my middle one didn't do any academics that when he went back to school, he was just crying, ""Please let me stay home, please let me stay home."" And I was just like, ""No, go to school. Goodbye, go to school crying, here's some extra tissues."" Call me cold and heartless but he needed to go back, and now he's fine and he's adapted to it. But two weeks of every day crying, ""Please don't send me back to school.""

And she was at school all day and she also would have after school activities and dinner normally. And so, while she did some of the same things, it was definitely much more limited. Also, I found like during the pandemic, when she's socializing with her friends, she's also not considerate with other people. She's constantly yelling on the phone to them. 
	And my son, who's a senior at high school is, ""I'm trying to study for my APs and she's annoying."" There you are, go. And I don't know like it's just like she's oblivious to anything else. And we don't need to, we don't want to hear all of the gossip.

I don't know if ADHD is on top of it. Like I said, because we were home, I was able to catch it, because I was working so many hours, I didn't see he wasn't reading well. He faked it and he was able to cover it from me. And his sisters would cover him because they would help him with homework.
	And I guess through their frustration, they would do it for him or give him the answers. That helped, even though that was a big fight because he fought with me every day, he didn't want to work. But his reading scores increased, he got better. But the management was so hard for them to keep them off the iPads, the computers because I felt so bad because they don't have the social outside, I didn't want to be the bad mom and say, ""Okay, stop, you can't."" 
	And it just, I didn't have the energy to tell them, to always watch over them because I am still working full-time at home. And so, working full-time then teachers calling me, ""Oh, they don't see him on the screen."" It was a lot. And then, my husband works at night, he comes, that was an argument in itself because he don't know what to do, so his thing is like, ""Oh, I can't do nothing,"" so he goes, so I'm angry at him, so I'm yelling every day. 
	And so, I wasn't happy any more and my attitude just changed. I just was always upset every day. I was always mad, and always arguing, and so this was how it was for me every day for a while.

That has created a problem in my house because I have my daughter who is right next to him and the bed basically is just divided by the one wall. They are separate rooms, but everything that happens in his room, every conversation, every movement, she could hear it. 
And then, that's why we always had a specific sleeping time so that it was good for everyone. Now, that has become a problem because she has to be up at 6:00 and if he stays up until midnight, 1:00 moving around, she is constantly saying, ""Tell him to be quiet, tell him I need to go to sleep. Tell him..."" That has created a problem, but I think in every household, we as parents, we try to overcompensate the fact that they were not interacting with their friends, they're not having physical activity, they're not outside, so we just let them get away with basically just being online or playing games",negative

And so, my thought now is, he's gotten used to this.
	When they go back to school, is this something that, is this kind of conversation or interactions, are they going to continue in person? Or is this just a gaming thing? Right?

	This has just made it worse, but I think it was going to be like this no matter what.

I felt that having it on the computer and being able to visually see it, also with me knowing what they were learning, it helped me to kind of know how I can help them.

	There was a flexibility of learning so that my children could kind of do the work where they can, you know, oh, I'll catch up when the, after school.

Which I forgot to say about Child 3 who's the one I'm speaking most about today, is diagnosed with OCD and anxiety and stuff like that. He's 18, like I said. I am thinking of having him reevaluated because I honestly think he may be on the spectrum due to some of his behaviors. But anyway, so what I wrote down is positive is that he can stay in touch with his friends, he can play games, use his brain a bit, and have schoolwork. Negatively is that he's constantly on his device. Really doesn't want to leave the house much at all anymore.
	And the worst was over the summer last year he, I guess, I don't know if it was from being on the computer or his phone, but he almost had a breakdown or I honestly thought we were going to have to admit him to a hospital because he became obsessed with thinking that he was cursed. He was watching these videos with people would say, ""If you see this doll or you look at this thing, you're going to be cursed.""
	He's always had issues, but this was, I mean, honestly, very bizarre for him to be out there with that. We had to get him psychiatric help. And he started taking medication. And now he sees a therapist and a psychiatrist and it just, like I said, he always had issues, but I think the whole Corona being stuck in the house and by being on, therefore then, the computer and his phone so much, I don't know what it did to his mental state. I mean, really had a bad effect.",positive

I can say some of the positives, but then I want to segue into what she was talking about because I found some of the same things. So Child 1 is my youngest of the six boys we have. So he was here by himself because he has health issues, so exposing him to COVID was a real concern. But one of the positives of the computer was that he could at least talk to people that were his age. He had something to fill the time, because filling all those hours was nerve-wracking for me. And sometimes you would hear him laugh and stuff, that would you bring joy.
	But the thing that happened with Child 1 that we had never seen before was that he also became obsessed that there were vampires and that they were going to come get him. And all of the same things that, I forget the woman's name that was before me, I apologize. But we saw some of the same things and I was so scared. I took all the technology away from him and he got better. So I don't know what that is online. And I'm an older mom, so I don't know as much about technology and what they're doing, but it was really concerning for me and scary.
	And then at the same time, you feel bad because then they're depressed that they don't have anybody, that they don't have anyone to talk to. So that was my input, but it was interesting that I heard somebody say the same things that we dealt with during COVID.",negative

I'm going to make a connection to what both of them said, because my son didn't really have anything specific that he brought out, but he was having nightmares and was afraid to sleep alone. So I'm wondering if it may have been something that he came across online. But to give you his positive and negatives, which some of which the positives are actually negatives as well. So he's very savvy, technologically savvy. So that for me was good because I didn't need to help him too much. I didn't have to interfere too much with that. He's very creative. So sometimes when he gets online, he does really creative things. And I thought sometimes it was good for occupying him, just get him out of my hair. I'm trying to work remote and he's here. So that was good.
	The negatives were he's a little too savvy that he can be a little sneaky and a little manipulative with it. And I wouldn't know, because I'm not as savvy as he is. He gets easily frustrated. So if he's playing a game and he's not winning or it's not going the way he wants, he'll start banging things and hitting the computer as if it's the computer's fault.

social_group,4,4,2,I would like you to think about the time prior to the pandemic and what your child's use of technology for education looked like then. Was it beneficial? Was it already problematic? Did you already have concerns? Did they not even use it?,2,"Well, I can start with that. Child 1’s problem was a problem. The only thing he's not very good at because of his cognitive disorder, he's unable to retain any information. So his worst subject was math. I think after a while, once he learned about the calculator, he was just cheating his way through math, which became more of a problem. Now, he's homeschooled and he just seems to use the modern tech, he Googles everything instead of learning. It becomes harder for me because unfortunately I'm in the medical fields. So I'm not able to work from home. I'm not home with him. So he's basically alone most of the day. But that's how it all started before the pandemic. Now with the pandemic, it just became worse because now he's again, Googling everything, using the computers. So he's not really learning much. That's all I have.",negative

And they use it pretty much exclusively. They don't really have books. So I found that that was really great, but to just have the computer to do all of the ... and I'm a retired teacher, so I do have some educational background, but to do all of his schoolwork through the computer screen and have a cognitive delay, it's not beneficial. He didn't learn what he needed to be. But I understand it's also the circumstances we're in. But I do believe that Child 1 and probably many other kids lost this year of educational growth. I don't know if that was your question, but that was my thought.",negative
social_group,4,4,3,What was it like during the pandemic?,2,"Frustrating. Very frustrating. Child 1 withdrew a lot, lost frends. Child 1 is not very social. So the couple of friends that he did have, they just kind of separated. I started to see less and less of Child 1. I mean, we live in a really big house, three floors and there was days where I would come home from work and he wouldn't even come out of his room, not at all unless I went in. And when I did go in, he was very agitated. And I just came back from vacation and I guess a week away from me, past two days, we've been closer. I don't know how long that's going to last.

He started college last fall, which he did. And then he signed up for this semester and he just got so overwhelmed with having to do the computer. He dropped out and he withdrew without us even knowing. And it was at a point where no refunds. He was also getting an excelsior scholarship, which now he will not be able to get anymore. So I don't really know what he's ... at this point, we're trying to figure out what he's going to do.
	I have my daughter as well, she goes to college. She has a couple of classes in person. She does really well though, she loves school. My younger daughter, high school. They're the worst program there right now, because whether you're blended or virtual, everything is virtual. So the kids that go into class go in, but with their computer and a headset and teachers are at home. But I do believe even for my daughter who has no issues, she will be a junior next year and it will be very difficult.

So even my son who goes to school two days a week, says that he sits in front of a computer at school with headphones. And some teachers who are there will come into the room. The technology has been both a blessing and a curse because yeah, it allowed them to go to school while they couldn't physically. But now that they're physically in school, I feel like technology is going to play an even more important role for them that I don't want. I think it's really important that they continue learning through a physical means like a teacher. I know technology is a big subject now too. Technology wasn't a subject when I was a kid, but it's huge now.
	But I just hope that they can find a way to really use it to the best of the ability and not just have kids get on it and do what they need to do. Even here at home, you had mentioned the other thing about technology at home and the difference between going back in school and stuff. And I'm actually really shocked that he's able to view YouTube on his school computer. They don't really put too many firewalls up for a lot of things that I would've thought.

They've always had iPads, so they still use them. I think that being back in school has really helped him. I found during the pandemic, before the pandemic, he'd used social media, which the kids use TikTok a lot. At least that's what I see and Snapchat. And he was using it. But then when I saw during the pandemic, he was using it a lot and using it inappropriately at times, or with people that I didn't want him to be chatting with. So I just used every parent blocking mechanism and I monitored it and he only gets it for a limited amount of time now.
	And on his iPad, he does do that same thing with the YouTube thing. I've kind of let it go because I just can't fight every fight. But I've seen him do that when he's talking to his teachers. I do think it's better that they're back in school. School's not exactly the same. They are wearing masks, of course, and they're trying to social distance, and they have a lot of restrictions. But maybe some of it just is that you get to see people. I know that when I got to see people again, it makes you happy. Being isolated at home with just your mom is not fun. Did that answer it?

I have three of them, so I can't control all three of them. But I definitely agree with what Child 1's mom said that it's too much out of control.

I mean, he's high functioning. He has anxiety, he has auditory processing, a whole bunch of different stuff. But he manages. And before the pandemic, he had his routine of what he did and it was good. He always has to have a schedule and know what he's doing. He'll do anything but as long as he knows it's something coming up, if not, he gets thrown by that. So the whole COVID, the restrictions just made it more difficult for him to figure out what to do with his time. They had all kinds of Zoom classes or sessions. He goes to the [program]. He does Respite Hab. And at that point, that was all he was doing.
	And he doesn't like Zoom. He's very overwhelmed by Zoom. You know how people, even you can see when you go on these meetings. Even me, for instance, I was on another meeting yesterday and I couldn't figure out how to mute myself and my dog wouldn't stop barking. So there are things in the background that he just really won't do any of them.
	His dayhab, thank God, it's a small one. He went back at the end of August. And except for a few days here and there closing down, they've been open the whole time. So for him, that's great. And then my son, Child 3, who has his other issues, being on social media, I mean, he's always been on it a lot before. And during it just became his only thing. He didn't see any friends in person because he was afraid. And I think that's what made him constantly watching these things that were scary and made him afraid. Like Child 1's mom. I mean, not that it's good to hear that about someone else, but it at least kind of makes you feel like he wasn't the only one because it was the scariest thing ever to just watch him go through that. He didn't sleep, he didn't eat. He just was panicked all the time, saying ""I just can't take it anymore.""
	And I think that's what did it to him, going on these sites that he just became addicted to. And moving forward, now he goes out a little bit, he gets together.
