social_group,4,1,1,"how was technology used for educational purposes for your kids before the pandemic, how did that change during the pandemic, and what were your concerns before and during, or what were the benefits before and during? So does anyone want to start us off? ",3,"Yes. So for me, they were a very big distraction before the pandemic, and it's a far worse distraction now to the point that I feel, and I've shared this with other parents, that kids can easily switch from one screen to the other and they're easily distracted. And unless you're there behind them, they can be on Instagram and whatnot all day basically. And because they hear the teacher speak, they know when to switch back. So I think the distraction was always there but they were not distracted in class so to speak, unless they were allowed to use their phones, which they don't, unless they cheat but it's been not good. I think the distraction has been detrimental to their learning this whole year. So yes, it's a great resource, they can learn anything, they can find anything. But if they don't have the maturity to say no, I'm not going to be browsing the internet while I'm supposed to be in class, it's useless to have them ... Just not good"

So does anyone want to start us off? ",4,"Okay, great. So I have three children. Two go to charter schools and one is in Catholic high school. And I think a big part of how each of them have responded to the technology aspect has a lot to do with the structure of the school. So my son who's in Monsignor Farrell who, he is the one who completed the Healthy Brain Network assessment, his school makes you stay on video, in uniform, they take attendance every class, they continue to watch you and see what you're doing and comment the same way they would as if you were in school. So if you are dosing off, if you're not looking at the camera, if it looks like you're looking down in your lap, they'll say something to you to address it.

My other two who are in charter schools, you might as well teaching to a bowl of jello because they are 100% having conversations on every social media platform, playing Roblox, planning the rest of their day. So I agree but I do think so my experience has been a mixed one, but I think that there is way for technology to be helpful when you have to as long as you have"

So does anyone want to start us off? ",2,"Yeah, I have a 10-year-old who has an IEP and unfortunately, a lot of his needs aren't being met through the computer. They're trying but he has OT and he spends more time screaming and crying that he can't do it with her as opposed to actually getting the [inaudible 00:20:08] twice a week. They're now in person, five days a week so that is has been huge. They're more held accountable at school, they can't take their phone out. So at home, I mean, I'm working from home, I have three kids at home, screaming at them all day to get on their computer, make sure you're doing your work, it doesn't work. And the private schools are working way better than public schools, absolutely like 100%"

So does anyone want to start us off? ",2,"The fact that the kids are going to school, there is not really a lot of remote teaching, they're actually in-person teaching and they have separate remote teachers for the remote kids. So the in-person kids are actually learning. Like I said, my two boys now are in person. They are learning and the teachers are there which is good and they're really getting something out of it, but it's only been for maybe the last month. So one month doesn't make up for a whole"

It's impossible for me to sit here from 9:00 to 5:00 and look at this screen and I'm continuously getting up. So she sits there from 8:00 a.m. literally to extra, extra help to 5:00 or 6:00. I'm sorry but it's impossible to sit all day here just looking at a screen. And it's not the same interaction. And I think teachers don't have a lot of patience. They're overwhelmed as well. Like I said, I have to keep reinforcing, telling her continue, what are you doing? And it's just a lot of me as far as I'm also working as well and I have another one that's learning downstairs, so it's a struggle but it hasn't been the same. And she's struggling in one subject which she wasn't before so it's hard"

All day long. So with me, it's constant oversight.

I use it as leverage, thank, god. Because god knows we can't use the computer as leverage. They need it for work and then they go on side track and go on their stuff. Yeah, they can't prompt the kid on the Zoom meet or the Google Classroom because if they prompt him then they're calling out on the kid and then that's like now they're picking on them so that's a problem, too"

I like the way I went to school, I had to actually read a book, I actually had to do research. So I find that frustrating, I don't think that, that's really mentally helping her to get to the next level when it's just googling everything and then now, these kids know how to get to websites and get a term paper written for them. It's a lot of cheating going on. It's a lot of cheating, that's another one. But all these tests, there's a lot of room for kids. There is a lot of room"

We used to pick up a book and a notebook. [crosstalk 00:27:12] We used to underline things and then jot down notes and read. And all this technology, all they need ...

So one of the things one of the schools that my kids go to on day one, he shared with us that because the world is the way it is and technology is at our fingertips, they were not going to require that our children memorize anything that they could Google or look up quickly, that they were going to place the value on how do we get them to really understand what the meaning of those things are.

So you can Google that Christopher Columbus sailed in 1492 which we had to painstakingly remember. But now, they're going to have you really think about why did he do that, what was the significance of it. So I do feel that there's something to be said for the fact that they can navigate the internet the way that they do, it does put more onus on us as parents to really make sure that they're on the appropriate sites. But I'm okay with a lot of this technology a long as the teachers are eliciting from them an understanding of what it is that they're looking up and writing down and not just that they're doing it blindly"

[crosstalk 00:30:14] I think my son has told me that certain websites are blocked from schools laptops and computers. So while they're there and they are supposed to be using the computer for schoolwork, they have that restriction that they can't go on Facebook or Instagram so something that here they can do, so they can't do that in school so there was certain some sort of restriction in school which I don't restrict the computer here"

So some things you have to absorb and some things you have to learn. When I'm in my job, my supervisor asks me for certain things, I can't just Google right there, I have to have the knowledge"

This is the year when they start to discuss college, when they fill out their forms, and they visit colleges. I don't see him or us ready in any way to do this at all. I mean I'm not looking forward to September. I don't even think that they are prepared with the knowledge because they need to take their exams and all of that. It's going to be awful, I'm not very confident about what they have learned this year and last year"

social_group,4,1,3,"As we are returning more in person, what challenges do you anticipate for your children in transitioning back to school",2,"There was a lot of resistance. I mean there was a little bit from the 10-year-old, but once he got to school, he was fine and he never, he once or twice, they're up early at 6:30 so it's an early day for them but once he got in, he was fine. The older one, just like it was easier to stay home and not do your work and you're being held accountable at school, whereas at home, I can only hold you accountable when the emails come in that you're missing all the work. Or that evening at 11:00 when I'm actually able to check it for you and scream like a maniac, you're missing all this work, you didn't do anything today. But you sat behind a computer and basically I guess you're on games or other things. I mean like I said, working parents really got hit hard with this"
social_group,4,1,3,"As we are returning more in person, what challenges do you anticipate for your children in transitioning back to school",4,"I think my son, interestingly enough, my younger two, I think they can't get to school fast enough and that will be in their best interest. My oldest, I think actually has done better, I mean partially because the school has done a really nice job of how they structured it. But I think the social aspect sort of distracted him a lot, and he felt different than everybody, and I think now having the opportunity to do this from home has made him less anxious about everything else and able to then focus more on the work. So I've seen him do better than he has in the past. Now, it could coincide with the fact that he also started taking Vyvanse but I do worry about how he'll feel. And we're moving, so now he's going to start a new school in a new city and be back in school full time"

She does not let that phone go for one second, not even for the bathroom, I've never seen such dependence on that phone which I call the antichrist because I myself limit my time on the computer. I just find it horrible because now it's just more part of her life and it's too much and I can't stop it, she's older now.

But it's really bad because I think she's not even socializing. It's just constantly on the phone, but my daughter focuses on that a lot because of her other issues that she has with socializing so she does it more so on the phone. But I find it very negatively impacting her socialization skills, her academic skills, her verbal skills. Just not communicating because now they text and they're doing all the slang and they're not really communicating like they used to. So I just think it's been negatively impacting on her. And all the fights in our house is because of the iPhone. I hate it, I hate it and there's not much I can do about it because she's already older"

And I think it's a sad situation of what we're getting our kids into and I take responsibility, yes, I do, but because my daughter has special needs, she's sharing a pad as well, she wears a couple of implants so focusing, texting, that's how it started with the main communication because that's her whole context of communicating more so.

It just makes no sense. All my friends do not want to talk to me because they do not believe I'm not on Facebook, I'm not on TikTok. I got to go to the park to walk my dog, get some air, go shopping.

Yes, there was a lot of gaming before the pandemic and there was a lot more to the point that we found him in bed in the middle of the night with a laptop or with a phone playing with friends.

All he needed to do was wake up 10 minutes before school starts, so he could spend more time playing. And we weren't really noticing that this was happening, that he was awake in the middle of the night with friends playing. We didn't realize so before, he needed some rest, he would be sleepy from waking up at 6:30 in the morning. But during the pandemic, there was no waking up early. 8:00 is not early so he could spend all night at the computer, playing video games and then go to school.

But to take a little bit of a different approach when we were early on in the pandemic and they could not safely go see their friends or be outside, even though I don't love the games and what have you, I did appreciate the fact that they were interacting with other children over the games. Because at least then as opposed to just sitting with the video game on the screen by themselves and looking at it all day, they were laughing and playing and yelling and getting excited because there really was no alternative at that point in time.

And since then as things have opened back up, we've gone back to having more conversations about when we have a choice, you always choose the in-person activity to get some fresh air. But the benefit to me during the huge crisis of the pandemic was that it did allow them to interact with other children and not just be completely bored and what have you all day. And [inaudible 00:45:58], I work in a hospital and my husband had left.

It's our job and our responsibility so yes, all these distractions are going to be there, gaming, it's going to be there, social media, all of that and I don't expect the world to change for me. I've learned a lot now. I see how social media and technology can be really good and sometimes it can be really bad, too.

So no excuse for me to blame anything other than myself as a parent and how I need to dedicate time to make sure my son is doing his work and getting enough sleep and not playing and things like that. At the end of the day, I take full responsibility for how he's learning and if he's not, then I need to make some changes. I don't know, technology's great. I'm learning accounting right now in front of a screen every day. It's just great and we have so many good things.

I'm specifying one of my two children, because they couldn't be more different when it comes to this. 
	For her, even textbooks being online is not a good thing. We still requested paper textbooks for her, because anytime she's on a screen it's never really been positive. Smartboards, and things like that at school aside, because obviously those are technology and I think they're positive. She literally... 
	Our school went to complete Zoom, like most did... although we went faster than I know some districts did. On Friday school was closed and on Monday school was on Zoom. They the whole time had run it the full day, just exactly like it would be in school, which I know increases the Zoom fatigue, but for her... She shut down. She stopped doing any work. She stopped doing anything. She would sign in to her Zooms, but it was like she wasn't even there. She would have other screens open and other devices open. She'd be on Buzzfeed or something else. She would show up to extracurriculars that were on Zoom, but she'd do the same thing. She was not present. She wasn't present in our family. She wasn't present in anything. She just completely shut down"

She needs people to bring her back, focused, and pay attention to her in a real way that you can't get on Zoom. And I think there are too many distractions.

I put... all my answers, I put both positive and negative. That was before Covid. Technology overall allows him to be exposed to things before they're mature enough to handle, anyways. That's a negative. Everything I see has positives and negatives. 
	Once Covid started... He has ADHD, so being in the classroom with the other kids was an automatic distraction. The teachers were always, ""He can't pay attention. He can't sit still."" It was always something. 
	Learning at home, I was able to... That first semester, last spring, I was able to sit right next to him. Oh, okay. We're going to work. I'm the power, you know? I was able to show him better habits of learning and work, which he was more independent this past fall. He did better with the computer. I think being out of the classroom and at home cut some of the distractions. He was able to focus a bit better to see exactly what was impeding his progress in the classroom, and what wasn't. That was a positive. 
	I think the entertainment systems, like the Xbox and... The Xbox was just entertainment, because you can't go outside. It was a form of entertainment for him. On a positive note, the phone gave him access to his friends so he didn't feel as isolated. [crosstalk 00:17:22] Those were the positive aspects of [crosstalk 00:17:24]. He's a social kid"
social_group,4,2,1,For the first part of the conversation I want to just think a little bit about how technology has impacted your children's education. Focusing on the educational aspect. If someone could share how was technology used for education before the pandemic. Did you find it to be helpful? Did you have concerns? Then how did that change once the pandemic hit? How was technology used? Did you find it to be helpful? Did you have concerns? Who wants to start us off?,4,"Who is 20. He's at community college. Right before Covid started he was doing... it would have been his second semester of his freshman year. He started having bad anxiety, he sometimes gets... in front of people he gets a lot of anxiety... around new situations... He didn't want to finish school. He wanted to take a semester break. He had a thing about being in front of people he didn't know, and not knowing what he was capable of. So he took a break. 
	Then in the fall, when it switched to... the only choice was remote, or online learning, he's like, ""Okay, I'll give it a shot."" He actually was very successful. He did really well. The teachers were... He also only took three classes instead of four or five, to make it easier. The teachers were accommodating, and he was able to go at his own pace. It was better because he didn't even have to... they don't have to show their faces on Zoom. He got a good, positive, outcome. He actually went back again this spring, and he's doing really well. That's where I think, in his case, it was positive to have class online. 
	I would completely disagree for my other two kids in high school. Absolutely not. They take advantage of being at home and having their devices. But anyway... The positive for Parent 4, Child 1 was that he could actually go back to school and not have to feel intimidated or anxious around other people. 
	The other positive for him is, in between this, he also got a job through DoorDash, and now Uber Eats, where he is driving part time. Again, doesn't have to really socialize with too much people. A lot of people just have the drop off deliveries. Enough where he's feeling more comfortable when he grabs the food, or says thank you. It's helped him a lot, and the technology is how he takes the orders. It's all through the phone. He has to correspond through the phone, and if he has difficulties he has to go through their help desk online. It's really helped him become very independent, and very self-sufficient. He's grown tremendously in terms of his self esteem, just doing these two things and having the ability to do that just in the last six months. I guess that's the biggest positive I can say that came out of this. Among other things"

In 2019/2018 we were both overwhelmed with all the papers that the school were giving and sending home. It was just overwhelming to even look at it. Now that everything is organized on the computer that he has from school, it's just a click away. It's either multiple choice, or fill-in, and he gets it done. 
	Now he's in high school and I feel that I can help him more. Meaning at the end of the quarter I can see what he's missing, and I can, myself, tell him, ""Parent 1, Child 1, get this done. You're missing this, this, and this."" I can sit next to him and watch him get it done, and check up on him. Also, I communicate regularly with his teachers to make sure that he'll pass on to the 10th grade. 
	In the 5th grade, he got left back. Yes, because it was just too much. Too much paper. Too much everything. Too overwhelming. In class, he would fall asleep. Here he has no choice. I'm here. I'm home. I'm going to be barging in his room like, ""What are you doing?"" I can check up on him. 
	I also feel like he likes it more. He doesn't... he has not complained at all about him wanting to go back to school. I do have him in hybrid, where he goes twice a week, which is good. He needs to get moving. He's a little bit husky. That's a negative that I find in not going to school. Not being able to mobilize and get your steps in. 
	Yeah... that's a benefit"

Another thing is not socializing. Not making new friends. When he was in the 5th grade, 6th grade, 7th grade, 8th grade, he had so many friends. I would hear him on the phone... or he would be like, ""Mom, I'm going to go out to eat with my friends from school."" Now that's gone. It bothers me, because now he'd on his PlayStation all the time. All the time. Now you hear him... he's talked to his friends only virtually, never physically, which I believe is important. 
	That's pretty much it. It's hard to get him out of the house too, on a regular day basis. I try to take him to the gym, or take him outside to get some sun. His vitamin D is very low. It just scares me sometimes. I don't know. It's hard to also make him take a vitamin D pill. Those are my concerns. His health, socializing... I don't want him to have anxiety when he's back in the public and everybody's back in school. The rush... the rat race, the trains, the bus. He takes the bus, by himself, to school. That's pretty much it. 
	But I like it. I like it because he has a chance to pass his classes, and I can see everything that's happening because it's right there on the computer"

",1,"Yes I can say it, because I already have it in my head and I [crosstalk 00:25:38] anxiety of meeting new kids, his new classmates, and the anxiety of making new friends, if they're going to like him. Things that all of us go through as humans, but he's 16. I don't want him to be peer pressured something to just fit in a group. I want it to happen organically, but it hasn't... It's just hard"

Despite that, she's concerned because more kids keep coming back. First of all, I think they need to learn to be social in the manner that they were before. I think they've lost that skill. They have to re-find their comfort and figure that out. 
	I also think there's definitely an underlining sense of fear, or nerves, depending on the kid. For a kid like mine, it's fear. Some are just nervous about interacting in a close physical space even though there are masks, and some people are being tested and everything. An extra kid showed up in Math and they put all the seating closer together. Everybody in the Math class was so uneasy. Teacher and kids. They felt too close to each other because now they have this whole mentality that that's potentially dangerous. That's not going to go away in a minute. Next year they're all going to be back in school, and they're going to be closer together. They have to figure out how to navigate all that again, which I think is a definite challenge"

Right now he's in a smaller school, but he's asking when he goes back, can he go to one of the big, huge, schools on Staten Island? I'm worried that if we do put him in a larger school that he'll lose some of the gains that he's made as far as his academics are concerned. 
	A counter to that, I can see the maturity that he has... I can see his growth over this last year, so I wonder how he's going to handle big school, small school, whatever it is"

	The older one that I was talking about that has the anxiety... They all have different forms, but the one who is worried about going back to school in the fall and not even sure if he wants to go back. I don't think it's because of the programming. I think it's because of the social component. He went to a smaller out-of-district private school. He knew everybody there. He felt popular. He felt comfortable being around people. Put him in a bigger environment... he's very nervous about that. 
	I've been trying to reassure him that now that he's selected his major, and he only has major courses left, it's going to be the same people he knows. He's starting to see that. They did have to go in yesterday, and they had to go in a couple weeks ago... It's a photography major. He even came home and felt comfortable because he had met some of the people in person. He's like, ""These people, some of them have all four classes with me this semester."" He's finding that some of them are probably going to take the same classes in the fall because they're only offered in the fall... certain ones.
	I'm hoping I can coax/urge him, encourage him to go, but I do see he keeps putting it off. He's like, ""I don't know. I'm not really sure. I haven't decided what I want to do yet."" He's 20. You want to have him make his own choices as an adult, but yet he's an immature 20 year old, an inexperienced 20 year old. I almost feel like I have to push him in the direction... not that I want him to go, necessarily... but where I think he's capable of going but he doesn't quite see that yet. That's the challenges that I have"
social_group,4,2,2,"Now, my next question is as we do start to return more in person and as people are starting to go back to school... What concerns do you have? What challenges do you anticipate your children facing as they go back to school for in person instruction? ",5,"Okay. I have three children. One of them just turned two in March. He's not going remote learning, but he does use his technology. He already has a tablet. He already knows how to work everybody's phone. FaceTime. All of that. With him alone we used to get up, ""Let's watch channel 13, Sesame Street,"" educational programs, stuff like that. He's like, ""No."" He needs his tablet to do his homework, is what he tells us. He needs his tablet to do his homework. What he's doing is mimicking everybody else, because he sees everybody else with a device, and doing something on the device. 
	My daughter, she's 10. She goes to [Success Academy 00:33:15], but she's been doing remote learning the longest. Success Academy were one of the first charters to go remote, even before the Mayor and everybody else was going to do the remote thing. They stopped the kids from coming in. They already had them going remote. My daughter's 10 and she's being doing remote learning for about a year and a half now. 
	I feel like it's counter productive, because I have to obsessively stay on her back. Where they give the kids a itinerary that they want... like when you go to college, you get your course itinerary. You got to go on. You got to be responsible for doing your assignments and turning them in on time. Stuff like that. That's how they're running the program. I feel like for self starters... for kids who are on the ball and you can give them directions and they can go follow them without anything... it's good for those types of kids. If your kid guides off for five minutes or gets side tracked, it's counter productive because you got to stay on they back. I have to know exactly what you supposed to be doing so I can know if you're not doing it properly. Stuff like that.

What challenges do you anticipate your children facing as they go back to school for in person instruction? ",6,"My kids were on Zoom full time like everybody else last year from March until June. That was definitely a huge adjustment. They definitely weren't able to attend as well as far as school. Their screen usage rally picked up. It was because now they had a screen. My kids, before then, didn't have access to screens in such a capacity. I don't have that many screens in my house. I only have one TV. Only two of my kids have phones. 
	There wasn't this intense access and awareness of what they could be doing on a screen until Zoom started. Zoom was incredibly difficult for all of them to keep up, to study, to learn, to know. They didn't know what was flying. Like the mother that just spoke said, I had to be on top of everybody's Zoom. It's six kids. It was impossible for me to remote work when I was supposed to be working. 
	This year my kids are all in school. They go to private school. They're all in school. Save for a few quarantines that they had to go through, the school did go on Zoom for a short while. The goal waS to get the kids back in the classroom. The screen situation didn't really get much better. They feel more comfortable communicating on a screen, now, with their friends. They need to FaceTime. They need to Zoom. They actually Zoom in groups with their friends now. If they study they can't study on their own. [crosstalk 00:38:12] ROBLOX.
	My 11 year old is definitely by far the hardest of all of them. She went from being on a computer and being a watcher to becoming... ROBLOX is the thing that she wants to do all the time. She'll grab my phone and say, ""I want to text my friends"", but inevitably she ends up doing a gaming. I hate it. Then she says she's gaming with her friends. She'll game and then FaceTime at the same time. No one else plays ROBLOX but her. I don't allow her to direct message anybody or accept anybody's messages on ROBLOX. That became a huge... it's a battle. There's no saving from that. I don't allow social media for my kids. It just... everyday.
	There came a point a few weeks ago I actually removed all the computers from my house, because they don't need to be on Zoom. They're not on Zoom... My 11 year old has to deal with it. I don't like... I literally took... We had three laptops, I sent them to my husband's office. I said keep them there. I told him he's not allowed to bring home his laptop unless we really have to do work.

Before Covid, and now, he's not so much prone to pick up the computer to do anything, make any transactions, scroll, or anything like that, but the phone... When we gave him the phone, our cell phone carrier has an app that we have on our phones so that we can control what he can access. We still have that in place. It has a bedtime on it when you can't access the internet. You can shut down sites one by one where he can't access. We've still had to do that. 
	The good thing about social media is that during Covid he could still have access to his friends... that he could talk to and still share life with. I found it to be a positive for him"

I believe her name was miss Parent 6, that spoke after me. When she mentioned her 11 year old and the ROBLOX... Oh my goodness. Before Covid, social media for my daughter was a reward. Like, ""Oh mommy, I finished doing whatever I have to do. I took care of my responsibilities. Can I use the phone now?"" I would give her the phone, and she would be able to, ""Can I make a TikTok? Can I do this, can I do that?""
	Now, because you have to have a device consistently, to me, it slightly took away a piece of my control level. Now you're on the screen all the time, you can just click and I don't see. I don't see what you're clicking. I don't see what you doing. I don't see what you looking at. I don't see what you watch, because I'm under the presumption that she's sitting at your thing and you're doing your work. You're looking at the screen because you supposed to be doing your work, your homework, your this or your that... but you could be looking at the screen and guiding off. There's been a couple times she was in class guiding off, and the teacher's now texting me, ""We're doing math and [Genesis 00:43:55] is trying to get on Instagram."" 
	I feel like it changed the dynamic of what they're doing. Like, what do you mean? I need the phone. I need to be on this, and I got to be on that. I got to check this now. I'm like, none of that is important. What's important is did you do your work? Did you check your work? Did you submit your work? After you've done that, you can have free time to do what you want on the phone. You want to play ROBLOX... they even incorporated that in school. 
	In school there used to be a little time for them to get a reward, or maybe to play a game, something like that so they could interact with each other. Now they got it on the phone. Now they got ROBLOX club. They got this, and they got that. Now when they give the kids the 20 minutes-30 minutes of free time where the kids could be inter... even though we're on Zoom... I could've done a class, or play a math game. They do that once in a while. 
	Now everybody's in a breakout room, and you guys got 30 minutes to play ROBLOX together. I feel like it's taken over. [crosstalk 00:45:23] I feel like there's no separation between the time to what you supposed to be doing certain things"

I've really noticed the change because now the two year old, the baby... Whenever I put my phone down, he picks my phone up. He don't call it ROBLOX, he says, ""I want to play Mario."" He has my phone, and mind you, my phone has a password on it and everything. The baby picks my phone up and somehow he gets in to ROBLOX every time. He be playing ROBLOX on my phone.

I also consider WhatsApp social media [crosstalk 00:47:10] They have this intense pressure. I have a 16 year old and a 14 year old. I find that... We all grew up without phones so we understand what it is to be home, and not necessarily have to communicate to the world every little thing we're doing. Every little thing that we're eating. They find this intense pressure to be on all the time. All the time they have to have something relevant, something that's cool, something they're eating, something they're showing, a selfie. I find it endless. 
	It definitely became worse now, because during Zoom they were spending all that time in their room. Now they're still spending all that time in their room. I'm like, can you come up? My two oldest girls, their rooms in the basement. I'm like, ""I need you to come upstairs. Come out of your room, and put your phones down."" 
	I actually started a new policy with them that they need to charge their phones in the kitchen because they're not sleeping. Even with all this screen time boundaries that I put on them, somehow they manage to do something or other. One of my daughters actually... I'm Sabbath observant, so we don't use phones Friday night to Saturday night. We do not touch our phones. We don't turn on our phones. We don't use electric. We don't use television. We don't use anything. It's actually the biggest blessing in the world because it's a religious requirement. We're bound. We don't do it. It's something that... We all are able to release our phones because it's from birth. I don't use my phone on Friday night and Saturday. I find that on those nights, there's so much more... There's just so calm. You can see there's less pressure on them to have to connect. We never connected like this with society when we were kids. We run home we did our homework. We could barely get the phone because our sister was on the phone. 
	[crosstalk 00:49:24] that negative where we couldn't use the phone. There's lot of battle. It's a lot of battle. The minute that my Sabbath ends, my 11 year old is on some device, coming to me saying, ""Can you please unlock this device so I can use it?"" I worry about how they're going to turn out, because I think that these devices... you said something about the good about social media. I don't think there's any good in social media, at all"

I do not allow them... I will not... That influence just has to stay out. It's enough. They get it on their WhatsApps. They get screen recordings of it. As long as at least they're not connected to another... and they're begging me, ""Why not?"" I said... for instance Snapchat, I have a friend who's daughter actually wanted to do plastic surgery because the filters make them look so much better [crosstalk 00:50:35].

At some point, it entertains them instead of me having to entertain them, especially during the beginning of Covid when they couldn't be with their friends. Right?
	My neighbor kept making fun of me for how much time I was spending outside playing basketball, doing relay races, collecting golf balls, and doing other things to keep him busy and off his devices. At some point, I have work, I have dishes to wash, I need five minutes not entertaining anyone, so okay, you can use it a little bit more. Then there are those ridiculous streaks that they have on some of these things. Where they have to and a message on Snapchat every day not to break the streak. He'll sit there just on streaks. This is my... the one who uses devices less, watches the Simpsons while he walks up and down the steps, and then has to get on social media to talk to his friends about a particularly funny part. I'm like, ""You're going to fall and get killed.""
	A lot of the fight is not left in me after them being home for over a year. You know what I mean? I'm wondering if it's even going to be possible to pull back to where we were before Covid, when they go back to a more normal life.

[crosstalk 00:53:24] public, or in new places he doesn't feel very easy connecting to people. With social media he has that barrier of not being that face to face. I think he overuses it and it's affecting his sleeping. He sleeps in, then he goes to sleep too late. He's 20, I don't know how much I want to be constantly taking his phone from him. I do try to put restrictions in terms of, you have to get up by a certain time and if you stay up late that's going to be a problem. I can't tell him how and when to sleep, but I can make him get up and be productive in the morning as much as possible, including giving him a couple morning classes when it's time to help them sign up. 
	For My 15 year old it's really tough because I'm constantly finding him using it during school. They're still remote... for the most part they're remote more often than not. They just shut our school down again because high school has too many cases. I'm working from home. I'll take his phone and I'll tell him he can't have it until between classes, or after class. Then I'll go in there later and see it's in his room again. It's a constant battle. I feel like now I've got to be a control freak which I'm really trying not to do, and allow him to earn my trust, but it's not always happening.

When I be like, ""Give me your phone"", she be like, ""Why? What happened?""
	I found a video in my phone of my daughter crying because she could not find her telephone. She was like, ""The baby had my phone, and now I can't find it."" She was so utterly distraught. When I was your age I didn't even have a phone. We didn't grow up with cell phones. You're addicted to having the device itself. ""Let me take a picture of my food. Let me take a picture of this. Let me make a TikTok right quick. Let me say that we're going over here."" Put the phone down. You can't even eat food without the phone in your hand. I tell them no devices at the phone. Like miss Parent 4 said, we in the same house. You texting me from the back room? What is wrong with you? 
	It's becoming an obsession. I feel like our generation, we didn't grow up having the phone. I remember I used to have to ask permission to even use the house phone at a certain time. That was after you did all your chores, or you did your homework. You know what I'm saying? It wasn't just picking up the phone, using it. I really believe that Covid, the pandemic era, is causing other problems. They're not being foreseen as a problem right now, but it's definitely causing other problems"

In that situation, social media was helpful
	There's good and bad in everything. I'm going to sum that up like that. Social media can be a good thing. It can be used for good. It can be used in a positive light. Then again, it can also be a negative. It could turn in to a negative aspect. You have to really control it. Like the other parents are saying. I even agree with miss Parent 2 when she was like, ""All right. When I need my five minutes, you can be on phone."" Because I know that's going to keep you content enough for me to get my five minutes.
	Now if I be like, ""Give me the phone."" They, ""Why. What happened? What did I do? Why are you taking it? I can't look on this? I can't do that"" I be like, ""No, Genesis, you can't. Put the phone down for 10 minutes. Put it down for five minutes. Let me see you put it down for 15 minutes."" This is a struggle for her. She can not"

[crosstalk 01:01:34] Colleges will see it, jobs will see it, friends will see it. It's never going away. You have to be very thoughtful and careful what you share, which is a hard lesson to teach them. And if you discover they already did something not really smart, it's there already. Right? I think it's extra hard because we didn't grow up with any of this. We didn't grow up with the opportunity to ruin our lives when we were kids"

I'm saying they're really opening themselves up to... A very good friend of mine, her 14 year old daughter... I never heard this term before... but was being cat fished. What's cat fishing, I have no idea. Somebody was trying to lure her. I find the reason I do so much filtering on their phones is because... it's like throwing them in to an open arena where anything goes. My 16 year old... I think she didn't realize what it was. I found it in her trash inbox. Not in her spam, but in her trash. All of these deleted porn email advertisements. She never [crosstalk 01:03:07]. I think she just kept deleting them, but when you opened one up it was blinding because there was no ""Click on this, XXX"" it was full on male, female nudity in an email. They can either get sucked in to something dangerous, or they could see something that just traumatizes them.
	As far as anything... I understand what the woman before me was speaking... she said about having a voice, but they also feel a pressure to have a voice. To have an opinion. To state their feelings. It's a little much. They have to feel like they have to expose their entire lives so that they can fit in. That they said something meaningful"

I'll just say the positives for Parent 4, Child 1 has been that he's been able to communicate with his friends, he's made new friends with gaming. And he's learned to navigate multiple, new programs. Especially, through school, which I think has been good. And just how to use whether it's the Schoolology or the music programs or the... In that sense, it's been great and I think that's something he can take, as well as other kids, too, be able to take with him moving forward.
	The negative though, yeah, is the constant gaming. And the I'm going to stay up while I know you're sleeping at 2:00, 3:00 in the morning and get online. That has been a negative. And then, just the constant screen time I think is not that great for their eyes, in general. Those are my two main negatives. I don't think I have, I don't know if I have a third one.

During the pandemic and after the pandemic, that basically was interrupted and I was trying to over compensate for the amount of time being in the house and the lack of socialization with his friends, so the sleeping time was interrupted and it has continued. At this point, basically he goes to sleep whenever he's really tired. 
	One thing, that was one of the negative things that I, negative changes that we're going through since the pandemic. I would say he became more introverted than before. One of the positive things has been his grades. Even though there hasn't been a lot of interaction or he still remains at school from home, so home schooling. The grades have actually improved. He's a high honors, though we did have the option to go back last week, five days a week. I chose to keep it the way it is to finish the year only because he has improved his grades and I want him to end the year with the grades that he has now. 
	Overall, the sleeping is like he's sleeping less, the grades are higher. There's less time spent with the friends but they do interact every day over text or over the games. And more online time. But overall, it's okay"

Those took a lot of, a little the work with me to manage that. But the positive is he started reading more and to help me with him not meeting strangers, my daughter started playing Roblox with him, so that was a plus. That kind of would help me to understand what game he's playing and so forth.
	And it helped me to see what was his struggles in school, because right before the pandemic, he was having these issues and so it's through him being home and seeing how he worked with the computer is how I was able to finally learn how he learns and what he likes. Because he tends to keep things to himself. That was the positive. That's it"

And by being online, I think she learned a lot of stuff. Negatively, as everyone said, she's up to all hours of the night talking with her friends. And then, of course, I'm the bad mom because I'm the only one at midnight who's like, ""Get off the device."" 
	And the other part is she gets very sucked in to one, Roblox. Tiktok and videos and literally, it's like she's a zombie and when I ask her to do something, and she doesn't respond and it's annoying. And also, because she's with her friends online and doing everything, she's been spending a lot of time in her room, so she'll rush through dinner so she can get back to being on the devices.

My 15 year old, my oldest, she was struggling with it and we call her in her cave, like you need to get out of your cave, you need to get out of your cave. The good thing is we started watching some TV shows at night making every like certain nights of the week we'll watch something together as a family and at least we get to socialize with them, because if not, I forget that she's even home sometimes.
	I don't even know she's there because she does not leave her room. Socialization has been a tremendous thing. My boys are in junior high, they finally went back full-time and yes, I sent them back full-time because I couldn't wait for them to go back, remote didn't work for them. And being a stay at home mom, being a working full-time at... is not the most convenient thing with three children. I became dependent on the Internet, like, ""Just take your iPad, go do something on your iPad."" My little one, I was doing work at 11:00 at night with him and I was telling the teachers, ""You can't mark him late, I work all day, I work after school jobs and I'm on the computer all day, I can't maintain him and he has an IEP with needs and they're not being met."" 
	He would get work done at 11:30 at night, so bedtime was a joke. It was like he could sleep all day because he's out of my hair. And his academics, we'll do at night with him. And my middle one didn't do any academics that when he went back to school, he was just crying, ""Please let me stay home, please let me stay home."" And I was just like, ""No, go to school. Goodbye, go to school crying, here's some extra tissues."" Call me cold and heartless but he needed to go back, and now he's fine and he's adapted to it. But two weeks of every day crying, ""Please don't send me back to school.""
	Internet, like I said, it was good for me, it was a babysitter when I needed them out of my hair so I can do my job. But it's killing me. It's ruining this generation completely"

And she was at school all day and she also would have after school activities and dinner normally. And so, while she did some of the same things, it was definitely much more limited. Also, I found like during the pandemic, when she's socializing with her friends, she's also not considerate with other people. She's constantly yelling on the phone to them. 
	And my son, who's a senior at high school is, ""I'm trying to study for my APs and she's annoying."" There you are, go. And I don't know like it's just like she's oblivious to anything else. And we don't need to, we don't want to hear all of the gossip. And I don't know, I hope after the pandemic that better, but I also can see as things are improving, she's also out and about more"

I don't know if ADHD is on top of it. Like I said, because we were home, I was able to catch it, because I was working so many hours, I didn't see he wasn't reading well. He faked it and he was able to cover it from me. And his sisters would cover him because they would help him with homework.
	And I guess through their frustration, they would do it for him or give him the answers. That helped, even though that was a big fight because he fought with me every day, he didn't want to work. But his reading scores increased, he got better. But the management was so hard for them to keep them off the iPads, the computers because I felt so bad because they don't have the social outside, I didn't want to be the bad mom and say, ""Okay, stop, you can't."" 
	And it just, I didn't have the energy to tell them, to always watch over them because I am still working full-time at home. And so, working full-time then teachers calling me, ""Oh, they don't see him on the screen."" It was a lot. And then, my husband works at night, he comes, that was an argument in itself because he don't know what to do, so his thing is like, ""Oh, I can't do nothing,"" so he goes, so I'm angry at him, so I'm yelling every day. 
	And so, I wasn't happy any more and my attitude just changed. I just was always upset every day. I was always mad, and always arguing, and so this was how it was for me every day for a while.

That has created a problem in my house because I have my daughter who is right next to him and the bed basically is just divided by the one wall. They are separate rooms, but everything that happens in his room, every conversation, every movement, she could hear it. 
And then, that's why we always had a specific sleeping time so that it was good for everyone. Now, that has become a problem because she has to be up at 6:00 and if he stays up until midnight, 1:00 moving around, she is constantly saying, ""Tell him to be quiet, tell him I need to go to sleep. Tell him..."" That has created a problem, but I think in every household, we as parents, we try to overcompensate the fact that they were not interacting with their friends, they're not having physical activity, they're not outside, so we just let them get away with basically just being online or playing games"

And so, my thought now is, he's gotten used to this.
	When they go back to school, is this something that, is this kind of conversation or interactions, are they going to continue in person? Or is this just a gaming thing? Right? Or I'm just curious like how is that going to play out? I hope to goodness not.

Even if you delete it, don't send anything that you don't want to get you in trouble"
social_group,4,3,4,What do you think would be problematic as they go back to school,1,"In person, relationships that they will be having, I don't think they're going to feel as comfortable talking in person. At least, in the beginning, as they do now behind a screen from the comfort of their house, they feel protected from their rooms, so they feel like they can say anything and it's not going to go anywhere because when they don't want to see it, when they don't want to hear it, they just turn it off. 
	But when you're in person, with the other person in front of you, I think that's actually going to, a lot of the kids are just going to become, are either going to be too shy or too introverted. I think it's going to take them some time to adjust back to how it was before, before he pandemi"
social_group,4,3,4,What do you think would be problematic as they go back to school,5,"the opposite. He's so introverted, since she's been home, she's not like this. She's normally out, bubbly, she enjoys everything she can. She joins this, I feel more like her chauffeur after school. She's into everything. Here, she's in the house, she never leaves her room. It drives me nuts. Drives me, she can't... go back to see people and human beings"
social_group,4,3,4,What do you think would be problematic as they go back to school,4,"And I notice students even in the class now, though, those who are in the building, they're still texting each other. It's going to be interesting to see how classrooms are going to be run. Because some teachers are saying they still want to use technology, as we're talking about reopening, and is that still going to limit that socialization? Because then, they sit there on the WhatsApp and chat with each other even though they're sitting in the same room. And yes, they're at separate desks, but they just they chat that way"
social_group,4,3,4,What do you think would be problematic as they go back to school,3,"I think my concern is like it's not so much as that. I think for the social part, over the years, they'll come back. It may not be as how we grew up, it is going to look different. No matter what, because there was social media from the get go, there was already issues with social interactions, I think. 
	This has just made it worse, but I think it was going to be like this no matter what. But what I do believe is going to happen, what I have received from this is my older daughter, she was able to kind of see what is due, what's not due. I felt that having it on the computer and being able to visually see it, also with me knowing what they were learning, it helped me to kind of know how I can help them. Because the other way with the paper and allowing the kids to write it, it was so hard for me to connect. 
	There was a flexibility of learning so that my children could kind of do the work where they can, you know, oh, I'll catch up when the, after school. That flexibility helped them to give their best when they can. And so, going back, I think they're going to lose that. That is what I see would be a issue. But with the social media, I had social media issues before the pandemic, during, it's going [inaudible 00:55:00] from my household. Especially, with the girls. Especially, the girls. 
	But I do like the computer but for me, I realize I know what all my children was doing before I'd have access to that information unless I went to school and the teacher told me. And I'm a visual person, because even if they tell me, it's not clicking. Whereas, when I was able to go on the computer and I see, okay, oh, that's what they're doing. How are they doing it? It helped me to know, okay, you know what? I can't teach you that, you need a tutor or I would find ways to help them so they could get better help"
social_group,4,3,4,What do you think would be problematic as they go back to school,2,"Yeah, I just want to say that I think socially, it's going to get worse. Because, but now they're out and about, there's going to be more evidence of being left out. All of a sudden, now we're going to be back to, ""Are you wearing the right outfit? Are you wearing this?"" And like, all the stuff that the one good thing was getting dressed was not an issue. She literally went to school at her computer and she would wear her pajamas or sweats and the whole stuff is going to start up again. I don't know. It's just I don't see it getting better"
social_group,4,3,4,What do you think would be problematic as they go back to school,1,"My camera was interrupted, so I just heard the last part where you said the clothing. Did you say they were not dressing up during the pandemic. And then, I know that's another thing that I personally also think of. Being at home, it's all sweatpants and pajamas all day. But going back to school, that they need to wear uniforms where my son goes to school, so that in itself it's work, extra work for me. Washing the uniforms, ironing the uniforms on a daily basis. 
	I don't mind if it gives him a positive outcome. But when it comes to also, yeah, dressing, that has taken a turn, as well with the way they feel comfortable now. Even when we go anywhere, he only wants to dress the same way as he dresses at home"
social_group,4,3,4,What do you think would be problematic as they go back to school,4,"I agree, too. My son will run around in pajamas all day, every day, and even when it's, ""Oh, run the trash out."" He's running out in his pajamas. I do think it is going to be a process of going back for all of us. Workers, teachers, students, and one of the things I know that we talk a lot about at school is spending just those first couple months, just getting kids acclimated to just being back and socializing again and doing whether it's the circles and getting to know you activities and just different things like that and not, even though they are behind, there is some lag in terms of the academics, but catching up on that after we get them socialized first.
	And not just the students, like I said, but also the parents and having workshops and things with parents and also for teachers. I know for us, for at least our school, we refer tons of families to you guys. And then, we try to look at some of the workshops and things that whether it's Child Mind or Healthy Brain offer and put that out there. Because that's what we're going to need, just a lot of that SEL support"
social_group,4,3,4,What do you think would be problematic as they go back to school,1,"I know that I also feel the same. My son went through all the studies about three years ago through the Healthy Network. And I wanted to call and see what else is offered in terms of getting help for him in terms of being in turn that the pandemic has the impact on his emotions emotionally, mentally and even physically. Because, spending so much time in a room on a bed, he's not even sitting on a desk. Everything is done from the bed only because of the comfort. Oh, I'm sitting here, my legs are straight, so there's no need for me to sit up on a chair. 
	The interaction, the emotional, mental, so I actually wanted to know if there's anything else that is offered just so that we can get the information"
social_group,4,3,4,What do you think would be problematic as they go back to school,2,"Well, one thing that I'm interested in, because she's been doing her school from home and the tests have been from home, her whole test anxiety of walking into the room, sitting down at the desk, having the you know, hasn't happened this year because... and math, that a lot of times she has this one on her lap"
social_group,4,3,4,What do you think would be problematic as they go back to school,1,"To me, the number one concern would be social anxiety. The way, like I said, the turn that the pandemic has, or the impact on the way I see, it's next door to you. That to me would be one of the major things and something I would like to get some type of help on the social anxiety. "

Because it really is something that's hitting everybody, whether it's boys or girls, because I have both and it hits them both.

Which I forgot to say about Child 3 who's the one I'm speaking most about today, is diagnosed with OCD and anxiety and stuff like that. He's 18, like I said. I am thinking of having him reevaluated because I honestly think he may be on the spectrum due to some of his behaviors. But anyway, so what I wrote down is positive is that he can stay in touch with his friends, he can play games, use his brain a bit, and have schoolwork. Negatively is that he's constantly on his device. Really doesn't want to leave the house much at all anymore.
	And the worst was over the summer last year he, I guess, I don't know if it was from being on the computer or his phone, but he almost had a breakdown or I honestly thought we were going to have to admit him to a hospital because he became obsessed with thinking that he was cursed. He was watching these videos with people would say, ""If you see this doll or you look at this thing, you're going to be cursed.""
	He's always had issues, but this was, I mean, honestly, very bizarre for him to be out there with that. We had to get him psychiatric help. And he started taking medication. And now he sees a therapist and a psychiatrist and it just, like I said, he always had issues, but I think the whole Corona being stuck in the house and by being on, therefore then, the computer and his phone so much, I don't know what it did to his mental state. I mean, really had a bad effect."

I can say some of the positives, but then I want to segue into what she was talking about because I found some of the same things. So Child 1 is my youngest of the six boys we have. So he was here by himself because he has health issues, so exposing him to COVID was a real concern. But one of the positives of the computer was that he could at least talk to people that were his age. He had something to fill the time, because filling all those hours was nerve-wracking for me. And sometimes you would hear him laugh and stuff, that would you bring joy.
	But the thing that happened with Child 1 that we had never seen before was that he also became obsessed that there were vampires and that they were going to come get him. And all of the same things that, I forget the woman's name that was before me, I apologize. But we saw some of the same things and I was so scared. I took all the technology away from him and he got better. So I don't know what that is online. And I'm an older mom, so I don't know as much about technology and what they're doing, but it was really concerning for me and scary.
	And then at the same time, you feel bad because then they're depressed that they don't have anybody, that they don't have anyone to talk to. So that was my input, but it was interesting that I heard somebody say the same things that we dealt with during COVID."

And circle the most important one on each",4,"I can share it. I'm going to make a connection to what both of them said, because my son didn't really have anything specific that he brought out, but he was having nightmares and was afraid to sleep alone. So I'm wondering if it may have been something that he came across online. But to give you his positive and negatives, which some of which the positives are actually negatives as well. So he's very savvy, technologically savvy. So that for me was good because I didn't need to help him too much. I didn't have to interfere too much with that. He's very creative. So sometimes when he gets online, he does really creative things. And I thought sometimes it was good for occupying him, just get him out of my hair. I'm trying to work remote and he's here. So that was good.
	The negatives were he's a little too savvy that he can be a little sneaky and a little manipulative with it. And I wouldn't know, because I'm not as savvy as he is. He gets easily frustrated. So if he's playing a game and he's not winning or it's not going the way he wants, he'll start banging things and hitting the computer as if it's the computer's fault. And again, the other is too much time. Spent too much time on it."
social_group,4,4,2,I would like you to think about the time prior to the pandemic and what your child's use of technology for education looked like then. Was it beneficial? Was it already problematic? Did you already have concerns? Did they not even use it?,2,"Well, I can start with that. Child 1’s problem was a problem. The only thing he's not very good at because of his cognitive disorder, he's unable to retain any information. So his worst subject was math. I think after a while, once he learned about the calculator, he was just cheating his way through math, which became more of a problem. Now, he's homeschooled and he just seems to use the modern tech, he Googles everything instead of learning. It becomes harder for me because unfortunately I'm in the medical fields. So I'm not able to work from home. I'm not home with him. So he's basically alone most of the day. But that's how it all started before the pandemic. Now with the pandemic, it just became worse because now he's again, Googling everything, using the computers. So he's not really learning much. That's all I have."
social_group,4,4,2,I would like you to think about the time prior to the pandemic and what your child's use of technology for education looked like then. Was it beneficial? Was it already problematic? Did you already have concerns? Did they not even use it?,6,"So at Child 1's school, every student has an iPad that they take back and forth to school. And they use it pretty much exclusively. They don't really have books. So I found that that was really great, but to just have the computer to do all of the ... and I'm a retired teacher, so I do have some educational background, but to do all of his schoolwork through the computer screen and have a cognitive delay, it's not beneficial. He didn't learn what he needed to be. But I understand it's also the circumstances we're in. But I do believe that Child 1 and probably many other kids lost this year of educational growth. I don't know if that was your question, but that was my thought."
social_group,4,4,3,What was it like during the pandemic?,2,"Frustrating. Very frustrating. Child 1 withdrew a lot, lost frends. Child 1 is not very social. So the couple of friends that he did have, they just kind of separated. I started to see less and less of Child 1. I mean, we live in a really big house, three floors and there was days where I would come home from work and he wouldn't even come out of his room, not at all unless I went in. And when I did go in, he was very agitated. And I just came back from vacation and I guess a week away from me, past two days, we've been closer. I don't know how long that's going to last. But with the pandemic, he has definitely become very withdrawn."
social_group,4,4,4,"What are some of all of your concerns with returning to school, in person school and their use of technology? What are your feelings around that? What are you worried about?",1,"I'll say Child 3, he graduated from high school last June. So he started, it's kind of back to the other question and this one. He started college last fall, which he did. And then he signed up for this semester and he just got so overwhelmed with having to do the computer. He dropped out and he withdrew without us even knowing. And it was at a point where no refunds. He was also getting an excelsior scholarship, which now he will not be able to get anymore. So I don't really know what he's ... at this point, we're trying to figure out what he's going to do.
	I have my daughter as well, she goes to college. She has a couple of classes in person. She does really well though, she loves school. My younger daughter, high school. They're the worst program there right now, because whether you're blended or virtual, everything is virtual. So the kids that go into class go in, but with their computer and a headset and teachers are at home. But I do believe even for my daughter who has no issues, she will be a junior next year and it will be very difficult. Anxiety is starting already to have to go back, even though she's sick of being home"
social_group,4,4,4,"What are some of all of your concerns with returning to school, in person school and their use of technology? What are your feelings around that? What are you worried about?",4,"And I feel like we haven't really finished with COVID. So even my son who goes to school two days a week, says that he sits in front of a computer at school with headphones. And some teachers who are there will come into the room. The technology has been both a blessing and a curse because yeah, it allowed them to go to school while they couldn't physically. But now that they're physically in school, I feel like technology is going to play an even more important role for them that I don't want. I think it's really important that they continue learning through a physical means like a teacher. I know technology is a big subject now too. Technology wasn't a subject when I was a kid, but it's huge now.
	But I just hope that they can find a way to really use it to the best of the ability and not just have kids get on it and do what they need to do. Even here at home, you had mentioned the other thing about technology at home and the difference between going back in school and stuff. And I'm actually really shocked that he's able to view YouTube on his school computer. They don't really put too many firewalls up for a lot of things that I would've thought. So while he's in class, if I'm not monitoring, he's got another window open watching stupid YouTube videos, which I hope he's not doing at school"
social_group,4,4,5,"Well, moving on to their use of social media. And when I say social media, I don't only mean Instagram, Facebook, or probably the actual social media that kids use these days, because those are the two I know. I also mean YouTube, other chat apps, WhatsApp, things like that. So thinking about those kinds of programs and apps, how did your child use social media or those apps prior to the pandemic? And what were your thoughts around it? Was it beneficial then? And we're going to go through the same question. So I want to hear about prior to the pandemic, during the pandemic, and your concerns for them in returning to in-person school",6,"So Child 1 has been vaccinated and at his school, all of the teachers who want to get vaccinated have been vaccinated and they are back in school. They've always had iPads, so they still use them. I think that being back in school has really helped him. I found during the pandemic, before the pandemic, he'd used social media, which the kids use TikTok a lot. At least that's what I see and Snapchat. And he was using it. But then when I saw during the pandemic, he was using it a lot and using it inappropriately at times, or with people that I didn't want him to be chatting with. So I just used every parent blocking mechanism and I monitored it and he only gets it for a limited amount of time now.
	And on his iPad, he does do that same thing with the YouTube thing. I've kind of let it go because I just can't fight every fight. But I've seen him do that when he's talking to his teachers. I do think it's better that they're back in school. School's not exactly the same. They are wearing masks, of course, and they're trying to social distance, and they have a lot of restrictions. But maybe some of it just is that you get to see people. I know that when I got to see people again, it makes you happy. Being isolated at home with just your mom is not fun. Did that answer it? Sometimes I wonder if I'm not exactly answering your question"

And what were your thoughts around it? Was it beneficial then? And we're going to go through the same question. So I want to hear about prior to the pandemic, during the pandemic, and your concerns for them in returning to in-person school",5,"I agree with what Child 1's mom said. I found that prior pandemic, my son would play just like video games with his friends. And then when the pandemic hit, it just exploded into like this world of social media and video games. And I didn't let my kids really reach out and use the WhatsApp or Messenger as much, because I was afraid that they might come in contact with people I don't know and I can't stop ... I have three of them, so I can't control all three of them. But I definitely agree with what Child 1's mom said that it's too much out of control. And even if I try to limit his time, it's like I can't tame the beast."

They're not going outside. I have not been able to vaccinate Child 1 yet. So I'm kind of iffy with him going out and being around other kids. It's like a no-win situation. You take it away from them, what else are they going to do?"

He's asked for a Facebook account, which we won't let him have. The good thing about him is that he actually gets easily bored with them after a while. And then he doesn't want to do them anymore. And he'll move on to the next one, try that one out for a little bit, and then move on to the next one.
	Before school, before COVID, he had a lot more activities going on. So he didn't have as much time on his devices. Now, even he goes to school, but he's home by 2:30 and back on his a devices now. And just playing video games and mostly watching YouTube. He wants to create a YouTube channel. So with that, I'm making him take a YouTube class about what's good about what you can do on YouTube and what's good and what you shouldn't be doing. So it's sort of like YouTube etiquette. So, I'm trying to compromise with him but also still [inaudible 00:23:46] be aware that he needs to still behave. Because he has gotten in trouble at school because of technology. So I just want to make sure that we armed them with the right tools to use technology properly if he's going to use it, which I can't stop him from doing"

We've also put a lot of parental controls on it. My husband's a software engineer, so he's a lot better about it than I am. That takes up more of my time now because I do try and check their phones every night after they've gone to bed, make sure there's nothing horrible on there. And part of that is also monitoring what their friends say too in their messages and in their chats and stuff. So it's a lot of work on us as well that we didn't have before"
social_group,4,4,6,"My other question was for parents whose children have just different disorders that they may be facing, how has the problematic internet usage or the problematic social media usage influenced that? For example, we've heard from other parents whose children have anxiety, how looking at pictures of people on Instagram, the way that they are living, social media influencers, like on YouTube and things like that, how that has increased the amount of anxiety that the child may be facing. Your child has been diagnosed with a specific disorder. How do you think that disorder has impacted their use of devices during the pandemic?",2,"I'm sorry. I don't know what it is. I've seen that no matter what disorder they have, for some reason they are geniuses that can handle whatever the internet throws their way. I swear because Child 1 cannot remember his left from his right sometimes, but he sure can remember every app, every song. It's crazy. I don't understand it."

How do you think that disorder has impacted their use of devices during the pandemic?",1,"I mean, I'll say, I think with both of my boys, my one son he's autistic. He has sensory disorder. I mean, he's high functioning. He has anxiety, he has auditory processing, a whole bunch of different stuff. But he manages. And before the pandemic, he had his routine of what he did and it was good. He always has to have a schedule and know what he's doing. He'll do anything but as long as he knows it's something coming up, if not, he gets thrown by that. So the whole COVID, the restrictions just made it more difficult for him to figure out what to do with his time. They had all kinds of Zoom classes or sessions. He goes to the [program]. He does Respite Hab. And at that point, that was all he was doing.
	And he doesn't like Zoom. He's very overwhelmed by Zoom. You know how people, even you can see when you go on these meetings. Even me, for instance, I was on another meeting yesterday and I couldn't figure out how to mute myself and my dog wouldn't stop barking. So there are things in the background that he just really won't do any of them.
	His dayhab, thank God, it's a small one. He went back at the end of August. And except for a few days here and there closing down, they've been open the whole time. So for him, that's great. And then my son, Child 3, who has his other issues, being on social media, I mean, he's always been on it a lot before. And during it just became his only thing. He didn't see any friends in person because he was afraid. And I think that's what made him constantly watching these things that were scary and made him afraid. Like Child 1's mom. I mean, not that it's good to hear that about someone else, but it at least kind of makes you feel like he wasn't the only one because it was the scariest thing ever to just watch him go through that. He didn't sleep, he didn't eat. He just was panicked all the time, saying ""I just can't take it anymore.""
	And I think that's what did it to him, going on these sites that he just became addicted to. And moving forward, now he goes out a little bit, he gets together. He's not an overly friendly person, doesn't have that many friends to begin with. So, I'm hopeful that the summer, he'll be out more. And I don't know, will move more to the outdoors than the indoors."

Prior to COVID, I kept my son Child 1, very sheltered. I feel like social media has made him aware and very angry, with all the new technology, because like I said, he's eight going on 40. His mind's like a sponge. So it's made him very aware of the world that I've sheltered him from. And very angry and scared and very worried and panicky. I don't know if that's a thing, because I'm still learning everything that he's being diagnosed with. So it makes him very panicky."

And both my children were a little obsessed with them to the point they were trying things out like these people do. And that's what TikTok's about really is you watch someone dance something, and then you dance it and then post it and wait for people to like it. And that sort of anxiety you get waiting for, ""Oh my gosh, how many likes did I get? How many dislikes did I get?"" And my kids were even joking around about it to each other or not joking around, but kind of competing, like ""I got 10 likes, I got 20 likes."" And it's a little disconcerting. It's like, ""Guys, this isn't reality. This is just stuff that's happening online."""

And my son is by himself. He has lots of brothers, but they're not here. So it's just really, really hard. But yeah, he wanted me to buy him likes. I don't know how much it costs, but I wasn't buying likes."
