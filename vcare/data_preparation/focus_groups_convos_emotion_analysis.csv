Well, they didn't use it as much. I mean, the teachers would assign some reading or math assignments on I ready and from time to time some homework. But yeah, that was about it.

It wasn't doing research, it wasn't hours and hours. My elementary school guy, he didn't have any homework on the computer at all.

Not all of it because she was assigned in school, but she definitely was on doing homework, I feel like, a good amount. Nothing like now, but definitely was using it. My middle schooler also, but not as much. They both did play games or use Instagram, my daughter was really into Instagram, not as much anymore but definitely games. Now it's just like a free-for-all. I mean, they're in their rooms with the door shut, I have no idea what they're doing all day. I just know that they're doing their homework, getting good grades.

So at first it seemed like a good thing, and I'm sure it is a good thing, it's just, like I said, it's just become overwhelming use of technology because they sit in front of it all day.

Nothings insured. We're self-employed and I could just see the whole business being wiped out so we did take a DOE iPads which was a lifesaver.

You can only go one day a week now. And I was able to get him in two days. And the fit that I got, screaming at me for five days until that day came, it was horrible.

When they were supposed to do their work I would go in and I would see them clicking out of the YouTube window. We received two laptops from the DOE as well, but before it was kind of limited because we had a desktop and we had a laptop.

Hopefully going forward it will be better, but we were in school barely, mostly all remote because of all that. But we've gone a few times for sure. My son, he's on the spectrum so he has all these social/emotional issues that usually prevent him from being able to get along with children. All prior to the school year... We did start a new school this year, so in September we went to a new school that we've attended this year, which was a group of 7-8 kids, when he was in person because of the cohorts.

But so far, in our case, I think due to the smaller class size, due to having a little more, I guess, personal attention from the teacher who is able to expand herself for the seven kids, it was overall good.

Using Google Classroom to directly reach out to the teacher and use the chat function has been fantastic. And then when she goes in blended she has more direct contact with the teacher. She goes in twice or three times a week with her cohort. So I like the Google Classroom set up for her as a sixth grader. Also, the smaller cohorts have been great. It's going to be, just to answer the other question, odd when it goes back to 32 kids.

I at least see what he's doing, which is probably more than what I ever got from him or the school, definitely from the school, before. So, that's nice to at least get a daily rundown of... It might only be a sentence or two each, but it's at least Something. So, that's nice.

He would not participate. He did not reach out in the G chat message or whatever. So that part has not been working out for us very well. However, someone had an idea that I overheard, and so I found a tutor, just another teacher from another school who does tutoring.

So the fighting has actually gone down. The flip side of that is he's just on so much more. The language has got worse on the game and I'm constantly having to stop it.

Smartboards, and things like that at school aside, because obviously those are technology and I think they're positive. She literally... 
	Our school went to complete Zoom, like most did... although we went faster than I know some districts did. On Friday school was closed and on Monday school was on Zoom. They the whole time had run it the full day, just exactly like it would be in school, which I know increases the Zoom fatigue, but for her... She shut down. She stopped doing any work. She stopped doing anything. She would sign in to her Zooms, but it was like she wasn't even there. She would have other screens open and other devices open. She'd be on Buzzfeed or something else.

I put... all my answers, I put both positive and negative. That was before Covid. Technology overall allows him to be exposed to things before they're mature enough to handle, anyways. That's a negative. Everything I see has positives and negatives. 
	Once Covid started... He has ADHD, so being in the classroom with the other kids was an automatic distraction. The teachers were always, ""He can't pay attention. He can't sit still."" It was always something. 
	Learning at home, I was able to... That first semester, last spring, I was able to sit right next to him. Oh, okay. We're going to work. I'm the power, you know? I was able to show him better habits of learning and work, which he was more independent this past fall. He did better with the computer. I think being out of the classroom and at home cut some of the distractions. He was able to focus a bit better to see exactly what was impeding his progress in the classroom, and what wasn't. That was a positive. 
	I think the entertainment systems, like the Xbox and... The Xbox was just entertainment, because you can't go outside. It was a form of entertainment for him.

Right before Covid started he was doing... it would have been his second semester of his freshman year. He started having bad anxiety, he sometimes gets... in front of people he gets a lot of anxiety... around new situations... He didn't want to finish school. He wanted to take a semester break. He had a thing about being in front of people he didn't know, and not knowing what he was capable of. So he took a break. 
	Then in the fall, when it switched to... the only choice was remote, or online learning, he's like, ""Okay, I'll give it a shot."" He actually was very successful. He did really well. The teachers were... He also only took three classes instead of four or five, to make it easier. The teachers were accommodating, and he was able to go at his own pace. It was better because he didn't even have to... they don't have to show their faces on Zoom. He got a good, positive, outcome. He actually went back again this spring, and he's doing really well. That's where I think, in his case, it was positive to have class online. 
	I would completely disagree for my other two kids in high school. Absolutely not. They take advantage of being at home and having their devices. But anyway... The positive for Parent 4, Child 1 was that he could actually go back to school and not have to feel intimidated or anxious around other people. 
	The other positive for him is, in between this, he also got a job through DoorDash, and now Uber Eats, where he is driving part time. Again, doesn't have to really socialize with too much people. A lot of people just have the drop off deliveries. Enough where he's feeling more comfortable when he grabs the food, or says thank you. It's helped him a lot, and the technology is how he takes the orders. It's all through the phone. He has to correspond through the phone, and if he has difficulties he has to go through their help desk online. It's really helped him become very independent, and very self-sufficient. He's grown tremendously in terms of his self esteem, just doing these two things and having the ability to do that just in the last six months. I guess that's the biggest positive I can say that came out of this. Among other things",joy
social_group,4,2,1,For the first part of the conversation I want to just think a little bit about how technology has impacted your children's education. Focusing on the educational aspect. If someone could share how was technology used for education before the pandemic. Did you find it to be helpful? Did you have concerns? Then how did that change once the pandemic hit? How was technology used? Did you find it to be helpful? Did you have concerns? Who wants to start us off?,1,"Then another negative is not getting his steps in, and he's husky. Another thing is not socializing. Not making new friends. When he was in the 5th grade, 6th grade, 7th grade, 8th grade, he had so many friends. I would hear him on the phone... or he would be like, ""Mom, I'm going to go out to eat with my friends from school."" Now that's gone. It bothers me, because now he'd on his PlayStation all the time. All the time. Now you hear him... he's talked to his friends only virtually, never physically, which I believe is important. 
	That's pretty much it. It's hard to get him out of the house too, on a regular day basis. I try to take him to the gym, or take him outside to get some sun. His vitamin D is very low. It just scares me sometimes. I don't know. It's hard to also make him take a vitamin D pill. Those are my concerns. His health, socializing... I don't want him to have anxiety when he's back in the public and everybody's back in school. The rush... the rat race, the trains, the bus. He takes the bus, by himself, to school. That's pretty much it. 
	But I like it. I like it because he has a chance to pass his classes, and I can see everything that's happening because it's right there on the computer",anxious

What challenges do you anticipate your children facing as they go back to school for in person instruction? ",1,"Yes I can say it, because I already have it in my head and I [crosstalk 00:25:38] anxiety of meeting new kids, his new classmates, and the anxiety of making new friends, if they're going to like him. Things that all of us go through as humans, but he's 16. I don't want him to be peer pressured something to just fit in a group. I want it to happen organically, but it hasn't... It's just hard",anxious

Right now he's in a smaller school, but he's asking when he goes back, can he go to one of the big, huge, schools on Staten Island? I'm worried that if we do put him in a larger school that he'll lose some of the gains that he's made as far as his academics are concerned. 
	A counter to that, I can see the maturity that he has... I can see his growth over this last year, so I wonder how he's going to handle big school, small school, whatever it is",anxious

	The older one that I was talking about that has the anxiety... They all have different forms, but the one who is worried about going back to school in the fall and not even sure if he wants to go back. I don't think it's because of the programming. I think it's because of the social component. He went to a smaller out-of-district private school. He knew everybody there. He felt popular. He felt comfortable being around people. Put him in a bigger environment... he's very nervous about that. 
	I've been trying to reassure him that now that he's selected his major, and he only has major courses left, it's going to be the same people he knows. He's starting to see that. They did have to go in yesterday, and they had to go in a couple weeks ago... It's a photography major. He even came home and felt comfortable because he had met some of the people in person. He's like, ""These people, some of them have all four classes with me this semester."" He's finding that some of them are probably going to take the same classes in the fall because they're only offered in the fall... certain ones.
	I'm hoping I can coax/urge him, encourage him to go, but I do see he keeps putting it off. He's like, ""I don't know. I'm not really sure. I haven't decided what I want to do yet."" He's 20. You want to have him make his own choices as an adult, but yet he's an immature 20 year old, an inexperienced 20 year old. I almost feel like I have to push him in the direction... not that I want him to go, necessarily... but where I think he's capable of going but he doesn't quite see that yet. That's the challenges that I have",anxious

What challenges do you anticipate your children facing as they go back to school for in person instruction? ",5,"Okay. I have three children. One of them just turned two in March. He's not going remote learning, but he does use his technology. He already has a tablet. He already knows how to work everybody's phone. FaceTime. All of that. With him alone we used to get up, ""Let's watch channel 13, Sesame Street,"" educational programs, stuff like that. He's like, ""No."" He needs his tablet to do his homework, is what he tells us. He needs his tablet to do his homework. What he's doing is mimicking everybody else, because he sees everybody else with a device, and doing something on the device. 
	My daughter, she's 10. She goes to [Success Academy 00:33:15], but she's been doing remote learning the longest. Success Academy were one of the first charters to go remote, even before the Mayor and everybody else was going to do the remote thing. They stopped the kids from coming in. They already had them going remote. My daughter's 10 and she's being doing remote learning for about a year and a half now. 
	I feel like it's counter productive, because I have to obsessively stay on her back. Where they give the kids a itinerary that they want... like when you go to college, you get your course itinerary. You got to go on. You got to be responsible for doing your assignments and turning them in on time. Stuff like that. That's how they're running the program. I feel like for self starters... for kids who are on the ball and you can give them directions and they can go follow them without anything... it's good for those types of kids. If your kid guides off for five minutes or gets side tracked, it's counter productive because you got to stay on they back. I have to know exactly what you supposed to be doing so I can know if you're not doing it properly. Stuff like that.

That was definitely a huge adjustment. They definitely weren't able to attend as well as far as school. Their screen usage rally picked up. It was because now they had a screen. My kids, before then, didn't have access to screens in such a capacity. I don't have that many screens in my house. I only have one TV. Only two of my kids have phones. 
	There wasn't this intense access and awareness of what they could be doing on a screen until Zoom started. Zoom was incredibly difficult for all of them to keep up, to study, to learn, to know. They didn't know what was flying. Like the mother that just spoke said, I had to be on top of everybody's Zoom. It's six kids. It was impossible for me to remote work when I was supposed to be working. 
	This year my kids are all in school. They go to private school. They're all in school. Save for a few quarantines that they had to go through, the school did go on Zoom for a short while. The goal waS to get the kids back in the classroom. The screen situation didn't really get much better. They feel more comfortable communicating on a screen, now, with their friends. They need to FaceTime. They need to Zoom. They actually Zoom in groups with their friends now. If they study they can't study on their own. [crosstalk 00:38:12] ROBLOX.
	My 11 year old is definitely by far the hardest of all of them. She went from being on a computer and being a watcher to becoming... ROBLOX is the thing that she wants to do all the time. She'll grab my phone and say, ""I want to text my friends"", but inevitably she ends up doing a gaming. I hate it. Then she says she's gaming with her friends. She'll game and then FaceTime at the same time. No one else plays ROBLOX but her. I don't allow her to direct message anybody or accept anybody's messages on ROBLOX. That became a huge... it's a battle. There's no saving from that. I don't allow social media for my kids. It just... everyday.
	There came a point a few weeks ago I actually removed all the computers from my house, because they don't need to be on Zoom. They're not on Zoom... My 11 year old has to deal with it. I don't like... I literally took... We had three laptops, I sent them to my husband's office. I said keep them there. I told him he's not allowed to bring home his laptop unless we really have to do work.

Before Covid, and now, he's not so much prone to pick up the computer to do anything, make any transactions, scroll, or anything like that, but the phone... When we gave him the phone, our cell phone carrier has an app that we have on our phones so that we can control what he can access. We still have that in place. It has a bedtime on it when you can't access the internet. You can shut down sites one by one where he can't access. We've still had to do that. 
	The good thing about social media is that during Covid he could still have access to his friends... that he could talk to and still share life with. I found it to be a positive for him",serenity

I believe her name was miss Parent 6, that spoke after me. When she mentioned her 11 year old and the ROBLOX... Oh my goodness. Before Covid, social media for my daughter was a reward. Like, ""Oh mommy, I finished doing whatever I have to do. I took care of my responsibilities. Can I use the phone now?"" I would give her the phone, and she would be able to, ""Can I make a TikTok? Can I do this, can I do that?""
	Now, because you have to have a device consistently, to me, it slightly took away a piece of my control level. Now you're on the screen all the time, you can just click and I don't see. I don't see what you're clicking. I don't see what you doing. I don't see what you looking at. I don't see what you watch, because I'm under the presumption that she's sitting at your thing and you're doing your work. You're looking at the screen because you supposed to be doing your work, your homework, your this or your that... but you could be looking at the screen and guiding off. There's been a couple times she was in class guiding off, and the teacher's now texting me, ""We're doing math and [Genesis 00:43:55] is trying to get on Instagram."" 
	I feel like it changed the dynamic of what they're doing. Like, what do you mean? I need the phone. I need to be on this, and I got to be on that. I got to check this now. I'm like, none of that is important. What's important is did you do your work? Did you check your work? Did you submit your work? After you've done that, you can have free time to do what you want on the phone. You want to play ROBLOX... they even incorporated that in school. 
	In school there used to be a little time for them to get a reward, or maybe to play a game, something like that so they could interact with each other. Now they got it on the phone. Now they got ROBLOX club. They got this, and they got that. Now when they give the kids the 20 minutes-30 minutes of free time where the kids could be inter... even though we're on Zoom... I could've done a class, or play a math game. They do that once in a while. 
	Now everybody's in a breakout room, and you guys got 30 minutes to play ROBLOX together. I feel like it's taken over. [crosstalk 00:45:23] I feel like there's no separation between the time to what you supposed to be doing certain things",disgust

I've really noticed the change because now the two year old, the baby... Whenever I put my phone down, he picks my phone up. He don't call it ROBLOX, he says, ""I want to play Mario."" He has my phone, and mind you, my phone has a password on it and everything. The baby picks my phone up and somehow he gets in to ROBLOX every time. He be playing ROBLOX on my phone.

I also consider WhatsApp social media [crosstalk 00:47:10] They have this intense pressure. I have a 16 year old and a 14 year old. I find that... We all grew up without phones so we understand what it is to be home, and not necessarily have to communicate to the world every little thing we're doing. Every little thing that we're eating. They find this intense pressure to be on all the time. All the time they have to have something relevant, something that's cool, something they're eating, something they're showing, a selfie. I find it endless. 
	It definitely became worse now, because during Zoom they were spending all that time in their room. Now they're still spending all that time in their room. I'm like, can you come up? My two oldest girls, their rooms in the basement. I'm like, ""I need you to come upstairs. Come out of your room, and put your phones down."" 
	I actually started a new policy with them that they need to charge their phones in the kitchen because they're not sleeping. Even with all this screen time boundaries that I put on them, somehow they manage to do something or other. One of my daughters actually... I'm Sabbath observant, so we don't use phones Friday night to Saturday night. We do not touch our phones. We don't turn on our phones. We don't use electric. We don't use television. We don't use anything. It's actually the biggest blessing in the world because it's a religious requirement. We're bound. We don't do it. It's something that... We all are able to release our phones because it's from birth. I don't use my phone on Friday night and Saturday. I find that on those nights, there's so much more... There's just so calm. You can see there's less pressure on them to have to connect. We never connected like this with society when we were kids. We run home we did our homework. We could barely get the phone because our sister was on the phone. 
	[crosstalk 00:49:24] that negative where we couldn't use the phone. There's lot of battle. It's a lot of battle. The minute that my Sabbath ends, my 11 year old is on some device, coming to me saying, ""Can you please unlock this device so I can use it?"" I worry about how they're going to turn out, because I think that these devices... you said something about the good about social media.

At some point, it entertains them instead of me having to entertain them, especially during the beginning of Covid when they couldn't be with their friends. Right?
	My neighbor kept making fun of me for how much time I was spending outside playing basketball, doing relay races, collecting golf balls, and doing other things to keep him busy and off his devices. At some point, I have work, I have dishes to wash, I need five minutes not entertaining anyone, so okay, you can use it a little bit more. Then there are those ridiculous streaks that they have on some of these things. Where they have to and a message on Snapchat every day not to break the streak. He'll sit there just on streaks. This is my... the one who uses devices less, watches the Simpsons while he walks up and down the steps, and then has to get on social media to talk to his friends about a particularly funny part. I'm like, ""You're going to fall and get killed.""
	A lot of the fight is not left in me after them being home for over a year. You know what I mean? I'm wondering if it's even going to be possible to pull back to where we were before Covid, when they go back to a more normal life. Have you loosened the restrictions and it's so much harder now to tighten them again? They don't see that it's not good for them. You see it. You know, but sometimes you just don't have the energy to do anything about.

	I found a video in my phone of my daughter crying because she could not find her telephone. She was like, ""The baby had my phone, and now I can't find it."" She was so utterly distraught. When I was your age I didn't even have a phone. We didn't grow up with cell phones. You're addicted to having the device itself. ""Let me take a picture of my food. Let me take a picture of this. Let me make a TikTok right quick. Let me say that we're going over here."" Put the phone down. You can't even eat food without the phone in your hand. I tell them no devices at the phone.

That was after you did all your chores, or you did your homework. You know what I'm saying? It wasn't just picking up the phone, using it.

[crosstalk 01:01:34] Colleges will see it, jobs will see it, friends will see it. It's never going away. You have to be very thoughtful and careful what you share, which is a hard lesson to teach them. And if you discover they already did something not really smart, it's there already. Right?

Which I forgot to say about Child 3 who's the one I'm speaking most about today, is diagnosed with OCD and anxiety and stuff like that. He's 18, like I said. I am thinking of having him reevaluated because I honestly think he may be on the spectrum due to some of his behaviors. But anyway, so what I wrote down is positive is that he can stay in touch with his friends, he can play games, use his brain a bit, and have schoolwork. Negatively is that he's constantly on his device. Really doesn't want to leave the house much at all anymore.
	And the worst was over the summer last year he, I guess, I don't know if it was from being on the computer or his phone, but he almost had a breakdown or I honestly thought we were going to have to admit him to a hospital because he became obsessed with thinking that he was cursed. He was watching these videos with people would say, ""If you see this doll or you look at this thing, you're going to be cursed.""
	He's always had issues, but this was, I mean, honestly, very bizarre for him to be out there with that. We had to get him psychiatric help. And he started taking medication. And now he sees a therapist and a psychiatrist and it just, like I said, he always had issues, but I think the whole Corona being stuck in the house and by being on, therefore then, the computer and his phone so much, I don't know what it did to his mental state.

I can say some of the positives, but then I want to segue into what she was talking about because I found some of the same things. So Child 1 is my youngest of the six boys we have. So he was here by himself because he has health issues, so exposing him to COVID was a real concern. But one of the positives of the computer was that he could at least talk to people that were his age. He had something to fill the time, because filling all those hours was nerve-wracking for me. And sometimes you would hear him laugh and stuff, that would you bring joy.
	But the thing that happened with Child 1 that we had never seen before was that he also became obsessed that there were vampires and that they were going to come get him. And all of the same things that, I forget the woman's name that was before me, I apologize. But we saw some of the same things and I was so scared. I took all the technology away from him and he got better. So I don't know what that is online. And I'm an older mom, so I don't know as much about technology and what they're doing, but it was really concerning for me and scary.
	And then at the same time, you feel bad because then they're depressed that they don't have anybody, that they don't have anyone to talk to. So that was my input, but it was interesting that I heard somebody say the same things that we dealt with during COVID.",anxious

So I'm wondering if it may have been something that he came across online. But to give you his positive and negatives, which some of which the positives are actually negatives as well. So he's very savvy, technologically savvy. So that for me was good because I didn't need to help him too much. I didn't have to interfere too much with that. He's very creative. So sometimes when he gets online, he does really creative things. And I thought sometimes it was good for occupying him, just get him out of my hair. I'm trying to work remote and he's here. So that was good.
	The negatives were he's a little too savvy that he can be a little sneaky and a little manipulative with it. And I wouldn't know, because I'm not as savvy as he is. He gets easily frustrated. So if he's playing a game and he's not winning or it's not going the way he wants, he'll start banging things and hitting the computer as if it's the computer's fault.

The only thing he's not very good at because of his cognitive disorder, he's unable to retain any information. So his worst subject was math. I think after a while, once he learned about the calculator, he was just cheating his way through math, which became more of a problem. Now, he's homeschooled and he just seems to use the modern tech, he Googles everything instead of learning. It becomes harder for me because unfortunately I'm in the medical fields. So I'm not able to work from home. I'm not home with him. So he's basically alone most of the day. But that's how it all started before the pandemic.

And when I did go in, he was very agitated. And I just came back from vacation and I guess a week away from me, past two days, we've been closer. I don't know how long that's going to last.

He started college last fall, which he did. And then he signed up for this semester and he just got so overwhelmed with having to do the computer. He dropped out and he withdrew without us even knowing. And it was at a point where no refunds. He was also getting an excelsior scholarship, which now he will not be able to get anymore. So I don't really know what he's ... at this point, we're trying to figure out what he's going to do.
	I have my daughter as well, she goes to college. She has a couple of classes in person. She does really well though, she loves school. My younger daughter, high school. They're the worst program there right now, because whether you're blended or virtual, everything is virtual. So the kids that go into class go in, but with their computer and a headset and teachers are at home. But I do believe even for my daughter who has no issues, she will be a junior next year and it will be very difficult.

So even my son who goes to school two days a week, says that he sits in front of a computer at school with headphones. And some teachers who are there will come into the room. The technology has been both a blessing and a curse because yeah, it allowed them to go to school while they couldn't physically. But now that they're physically in school, I feel like technology is going to play an even more important role for them that I don't want. I think it's really important that they continue learning through a physical means like a teacher. I know technology is a big subject now too. Technology wasn't a subject when I was a kid, but it's huge now.
	But I just hope that they can find a way to really use it to the best of the ability and not just have kids get on it and do what they need to do. Even here at home, you had mentioned the other thing about technology at home and the difference between going back in school and stuff. And I'm actually really shocked that he's able to view YouTube on his school computer. They don't really put too many firewalls up for a lot of things that I would've thought.

I found during the pandemic, before the pandemic, he'd used social media, which the kids use TikTok a lot. At least that's what I see and Snapchat. And he was using it. But then when I saw during the pandemic, he was using it a lot and using it inappropriately at times, or with people that I didn't want him to be chatting with. So I just used every parent blocking mechanism and I monitored it and he only gets it for a limited amount of time now.
	And on his iPad, he does do that same thing with the YouTube thing. I've kind of let it go because I just can't fight every fight. But I've seen him do that when he's talking to his teachers. I do think it's better that they're back in school. School's not exactly the same. They are wearing masks, of course, and they're trying to social distance, and they have a lot of restrictions. But maybe some of it just is that you get to see people. I know that when I got to see people again, it makes you happy. Being isolated at home with just your mom is not fun. Did that answer it?

It's pretty similar to what you guys are saying. My son is the oldest, he's 12, so he didn't really use technology much in school. He's ADHD, as well as dyslexic. So purposefully, they avoided technology just for the process of writing is better. So he did use some apps for reading, like Learning Ally for reading and stuff. But basically, one positive thing is he's definitely learned how to type, which is amazing. At first I would watch him. It was so tedious. It was painful. For him, some parts would have been positive, like learning to type, it actually helped him be a little more organized because all of his work was in Google Classroom instead of forgetting papers at school. And so, he would get a notification from his teacher that he had work to do, and it would be right there.
	It wasn't something that he'd written and forgotten about or whatever. So in a lot of ways, it sort of helped him be a little more accountable because it was just in his face. I could look at it and see and help him. I don't know if he says he didn't have something, I could see that he did and it wasn't just something that he forgot he had, right? The negatives are definitely what you're saying, as far as being distracted and like... It was hopeless. I tried so hard in the beginning to keep him off of video games. But for him, it was a total distraction, but somehow he was able to manage to keep up with schoolwork. I don't know how he did it, but he definitely did his schoolwork, in addition to watching videos while the teacher was talking, which makes no sense.
	It would drive me batty, but the same thing. I'm trying to work and I can't stay on top of him. I tried all the screen time things, but then he would just find ways around it. The greatest one was figuring out that he had to have Google Docs. So he figured out how he could import his YouTube videos into Google Doc and watch them, even though I turned off YouTube. One day, I'm like, ""How is he watching that?"" And he even told me, he was like, ""Oh!""

And I think that I'm going to see what I saw at the very end of the year when they went back. And I think I'm going to see that in the fall, meaning towards the end of the year, my son was failing out of school. And it was because I don't think anybody was monitoring him. At least when he was home, I was monitoring him a little bit. Enough to be like, ""Did you do this? Did you do that?""
	Well, I'm not a helicopter parent anyway, but I'm certainly not... I'm thinking that he's got special ed teachers who keep him on track and make them write down what he needs to do at the end of every day. But I found out that he was missing entire homeworks, entire reports, and when I would ask him, he would, ""Oh yeah, no, I turned everything in. Everything's totally fine."" And then I get an email from the school saying, ""He's got an F,"" Or ""He's got a D."" He's missing these six things. And so I anticipate it's going to be very similar to that.
	As Parent 2 mentioned with the dyslexia, my son also has dyslexia. He was just diagnosed, though. And it's not the one where you flip the things. It's a much more weird. I don't know. Anyways, he's doing the Wilson book programs. And so, and he has summer school because of it, because and he's only on grade three, it's really bad. And so, I mean, the guy can barely read, and even when he reads, he can't comprehend. So I just feel like I'm already starting off with just a huge catch-up that is unrealistic. He's not going to catch up. And so it's going to take years to get there. And it's going to take a lot of summer school, so.
	I mean, and I think that I actually anticipate that he's going to need outside help and not just tutors, but people who are specifically trained in where he has deficiencies, with the ADHD and the focusing and the reading comprehension, and really, because he has to unlearn the way he learned and then relearn it a different way with the Wilson, that I think that I'm just anticipating a shit show",anxious

And so I think going back, I think that he has learned some executive skills that he didn't have before, which is really good for somebody who's 16 and theoretically will fly the coop in two years. I do think he has expressed the fact that he is looking forward to going back to school. Because he will not be allowed to play video games while he's supposed to be listening to the teachers, so that's a good thing. I do agree that he has not learned as much as he should have. And I think that the thing that I'm most worried about is his math because he's supposed to go into pre-calculus next year, and I'm not sure he knows trigonometry or whatever he was supposed to learn this year. But we'll deal with it, tutors, whatever if he gets into trouble.
	I'm not sure that I would agree with leaving everybody back because I do think... For my daughter, she's much more high functioning than my son. And she had a 99 average between her classes and went to school and got all her schoolwork done and never handed anything in late. And meanwhile, my son had 20 missing assignments the day before school ended, and somehow he got it down to six. So, I think my daughter, I think she actually benefited because she's a seventh-grade girl and seventh-grade girls are so mean to each other and the fact that they were at home and did not have to interact with all the other mean girls. I think that was actually good for her. So-",serenity

We've heard a lot of parents talk about the pros and cons of the ways in which their children's teachers have managed their kid's specific needs, how Google classroom plays a role. How discord, how these other online resources affect that. So I just wanted to know, from you guys' perspective, how your specific teachers have either contributed or aided in the problems that your kids have dealt with throughout the pandemic and online technology in-school use and things like that.",2,"One thing I would say sort of to add to both of these things is my daughter's 10, and she's in fifth grade. So one negative thing that I saw that her teacher actually helped with a little was I think it was a lot for them to have to stare at themselves on the screen all the time. My daughter started, I don't know, worrying about things about herself, like ""My eyebrows are too... You can't see my..."", all these crazy things. And it's because she's looking at all of her friends and herself straight on all the time. So it did become sort of a conversation with her teacher. And they were pretty strict at first about trying to get them to turn all their cameras on.
	But I think they became a little more lenient when they sort of realized that kids can have their camera off but still be paying attention, which is the case with my daughter, probably not my son. But my daughter definitely, she would be doing what she needed to do most of the time. But so I do think it kind of, I don't know, it was this weird... She became a little more self-conscious, I think, I don't know.
	But then it was interesting also to see the difference between my daughter's teachers and my son's teachers. He had way more daily, all the time classes in-person on Zoom. Whereas my daughter was a little more... She did have in-person, but it was, I don't know, half the amount of time as him probably. So I don't know. She had to work more independently than he did. I don't know.",serenity

So I think that the teachers... It really depended on the type of teacher. The general ed teachers, I found, were less tolerant of any adjustments to the technology or to the timeframes of things. And they were just less flexible. And I think it's because they were just overwhelmed with so many kids, plus so many kids with technology issues. And my boys didn't have the same experience because I don't have a girl. But I really, if I had been her, I would have been like, ""Oh my God, oh my God."" I would have been like, ""Whoa, this is not good. Everybody's seeing me."" I would have flipped, so. But my kids are like, ""I have to shower, what?"" So I think that the general ed teachers were... I found some of them to be mean and just intolerant to any adjustments.
	And, but then the special ed teachers would come in and say, ""Okay, let's deal with this."" And much the way they do at the actual school in-person. And so, I felt that they really helped facilitate the situation. And also act as a go-between in between me, the general ed teacher, and [inaudible 00:42:49] and my kids, both of them really. And so, I think that because they had two teachers, that really helped a lot. But also, I would find they would just disappear. We would log into school, and they would be like, ""So-and-so is out."" Okay. And they would be out for one day. ""So here's an assignment. We're not going to give you any instructions."" Or ""We don't have a teacher for you because we don't have subs. So go do it.""
	And that was very hard for them to understand that. And then you had also the ones who were like, ""Well, I'm out for whatever,"" or ""I'm sick."" A lot of them did get sick, so they were out for a month. And so, in that case, if they had two teachers, the other one picked up the slack. But it was mostly just one day here, one day there, where it wasn't anticipated. And so the kids were just sort of left hanging. And it was tough because they were like, ""Well, how do we do attendance if she's not there? Or he's not there?"" And it was just, Anyway, I think the teachers were frustrated, and that showed, that came through very much so. And honestly, they should have been frustrated. It was frustrating for everybody. So, that's it.",anxious

Right now, it's hard to get my kids to... I don't know. They feel like they've become hermits in some ways. So it is hard for me to get them to think outside of their video game box.

Do you have anything to say about any challenges you're anticipating in going back and returning to being fully in-person?",1,"I'll go. I think, first of all, we need to remember that it's not the '80s, and we're in a totally different era with or without COVID. I think that they are online all the time. And talk to adults who are young, much younger than us, but still in their 20s and things. And that's how they live. They're constantly online, be it for work and for gaming. And in some cases, I think that's just going to be the new norm, and it's not all bad because some gaming will teach you strategy and it's conflict resolution and all sorts of things. I mean, you can go one way or the other. In terms of the gaming, though. I think that I'm seeing that my youngest, my eight-year-old is much more addicted than he ever was.
	Before. Yes, he had my iPad. Yes, but I could easily take it away from him. Now, it's almost like the Chromebooks became a gateway drug to this whole, like a video game addiction thing. And both of my kids are complete addicts, complete. If I take it away from them, they will go through absolute withdrawals, to the point where I'm like, ""Whoa, this is not an appropriate reaction to what's going on."" And the world is ending apparently, if I turn off the internet, so. And so I think that because it's sort of the Chromebooks came in and they figured out how to use them, and the teachers taught them how to use them. Now they've got all these skills that they can use for good or evil. And so they're using it for both.
	And I do find my eight-year-old, who would never lie and sneak, sneaks the iPad, sneaks the video games. He still admits to it, but soon, he will not admit to it. And he will not say, ""Oh mom, last night I woke up, and I played the video."" At some point, he's going to start lying. My other one is I actually have to cut him off at the knees. I have to say, ""Everything's being shut down in 10 minutes."" Otherwise, he will be up until 3:00 AM, every single night playing, playing, playing. And so are all of his friends. That's what I don't understand. I'm like, ""Who are you playing with?"" And he's like, ""All of my friends."" And so they're all. I don't know what's going on, but everybody is just constantly on video games.
	And that's how they interact socially. And we're not into play dates yet anymore, or them getting together socially outside yet. Maybe it's because everybody tends to have younger kids. So they don't want to expose those who are vaccinated. I mean, those who are not vaccinated to anything, which I totally get. And so they still need that for socialization. So I'm stuck, I'm stuck between both. And I think it's just going to get worse, and I think we just need to embrace it and try and figure out what they're really getting out of it in a positive way and emphasize that.
	And so, and I think there are a lot... I can't think of all of them now, but I read an article that was just really, it was pro-gaming, and it was awesome. Because I was like, ""Oh, I never thought of that."" The strategy and conflict resolution. And they had brothers who lived... Were really close, and then they moved far away from each other. But the one thing they had in common was video games, and they talk every day. That's a good thing. And so I think there's a lot of positives that people forget about.

So, being at home and doing school, she actually, she was my best one. She was not doing that great in school, but at home, she actually, she was on time for every meeting. She knew when to sign in and log in. I think she was just so much more comfortable being at home and I was there all the time. So, that was nice, see that in her. ",anxious
gaming_group,1,4,2,"Yeah. It seems like I'm hearing a little bit of a difference between younger and older kids, and how exposed they were to technology before. Let's shift, now, into now that technology was being used more for school purposes, during the pandemic, did you find it beneficial for educational purposes? I know, Parent 4, you mentioned for the research part. Concerns, problems, as it relates to using it for educational purposes.",4,"Well, I would say that, yes, Thea is the same way. She would... And she does, and that's my problem, but for her, she likes being at home. She's an introvert. She's perfectly happy to be here on her own, just looking at the computer. And so, last semester was difficult, but in the one trimester, but the one that just finished, she actually had the grades, were the best they've ever been. 
	She doesn't have the social issues. She just, she is dyslexic. So, for her to just be focused on this computer, it actually works well for her. And, of course, what I did, because of the whole roadblocks and all the other issues, I put so many restrictions on that computer. I used a springtime from the Apple. I bought Custodio, for her phone. 
	I bought so many restrictions that if she was going to be on the computer, what she wanted to do wasn't a whole lot to do except schoolwork. So, what actually helped her in that sense. She actually did better. It makes me insane because she doesn't get out of that chair. But in terms of the ocular work, I think it worked okay for her super. Some kids, it can work, I still don't think it's good for them. Even though she's doing better, I still don't think it's good. ",anxious
gaming_group,1,4,3,"Anyone else, are there any parts that you would like to see continue, or specific parts that you would hope would end? ",3,"I mean, I would say for us, like I mentioned before, as long as they can swipe up their homework, that's definitely been helpful. But other than that, I agree there's really no need, because they can take care of everything at school. So, for neatness' sake, they can type it up and print it out. That's fine. Reports to research, I'm okay with that, but anything else I feel like it's unnecessary. 
	And to speak to what Parent 5 and Parent 2 has said, my son also has ODD, and it has gotten worse as we've been home. Like I said, it's been a weird thing with dyslexia improving with some of the things he's managing, but all the other stuff is falling apart. So, if he were more attentive, I would send him to school. But he forgets, he loses his mask, puts his hand in his mouth. If he gets bored, he just starts jumping, rolling around. It's not feasible for me to send him in now, as much as I would love him to have that in-person experience.
	But yeah, I definitely agree that the computers must go, at least at home. I don't care what they do in school. They sometimes behave better in school. They're more compliant, when they come home, they want to relax. So, it's a little bit different. I would be perfectly happy to just keep it for bare, and then they can always catch up, because there's computers everywhere. So, I don't fear they'll be falling behind in their knowledge and experience.",anxious
gaming_group,1,4,3,"Anyone else, are there any parts that you would like to see continue, or specific parts that you would hope would end? ",5,"I absolutely want these things out of my house, especially the school issued ones that I can't institute control over. That really bugged me. I understood, in the sense that they didn't want me also messing up their machine, but if I can't keep my kid off inappropriate YouTube sites, then it's not an appropriate tool.
	However, I'm trying here to think about, how could you do it in a positive way? Because I feel obligated. Media studies is my thing. I'm not anti media studies, but I teach college students, I do not teach ignorance. There's a big difference. But I think some of the problems with the online reading programs and mass problems, for me, well, there's two things.
	One, I don't think the kids get real feedback. Yes, the game tells you if you got the question right or wrong, but I don't think it's the same effect as a person that you haven't had a relationship with, the teacher, expressing that, ""Wow, I've noticed that you've been improving."" Or, ""I noticed you're not doing as well today. Are you sleeping?"" Whatever it is, that kind of response feedback is really crucial, especially the younger they are, not just an instant little... The game fanfare and stuff is fine.
	But two is, as a parent, I have no idea what they're doing when it's online. You don't get a print here. It's not like getting the papers. And I got too much paper before this, then I would get home like, ""Oh my child wrote all these sentences."" Or, ""These are their math worksheets. I can see what they're doing, and what they're struggling with. I can see their handwriting improving."" I can't see anything. And the teachers on the report cards, they don't say much. Just, it's like, ""Meet standards. Approaching standards."" But what does that mean? I can't see the material. 
	I mean, unless I don't work and sit next to them all day and watch them doing it, which is incredibly boring on top of everything, on top of just not being possible. So, in theory, if there were some programs or a way of using that involved, both things, like some practice of the math online, but also some way of a parent viewing results quickly, like getting, I don't know, a weekly snapshot of like, ""What did your child do? How many problems did they miss? Does it look like they're walking away maybe because they're not doing any of it?"" I mean, different way to get contact.",disgust

Well, it didn't take me by surprise, but returning to behaviors that we'd spent two years working on building a support system in school to prevent it from happening, and just that had eroded.
	What I didn't anticipate is that back in school that they're really not still meeting their friends. We need to meet new friends, because it's a new school. Even with recess, it's still very slow. Maybe it's because we were just separate from people for so long, but it's a lot more difficult than it usually is for them to make friendship connections.",anxious

March 22nd, we opted into cohort one, which is Monday and Tuesday, and every other Friday. 
	But it's a problem also, you have to carry your laptop into school. I just wonder, in New York City, so everyone knows that every kid out on the street has a laptop in their backpack. I'm just waiting for... Not to mention their phone. But it's been positive for him, even going in and having the onscreen class, because he's getting to know the building. It's a new high school, I mean, for him, and he has met some kids. So, just finding his way around the building is the thing, and meeting kids in the flesh. So, it's been a plus.",serenity

Because, right now, they can wake up five minutes before their class. They can brush their teeth in between breaks, or between classes rather. Like they can eat in front of the screen. They don't have to worry so much about their outfit, and being comfortable. They can lay in bed when they're in class, it's fine.
	Once they start school, they can't do any of that. And my oldest actually expressed that to me. She said, ""I'm concerned."" Because she started sixth grade this year, and it's a new group of kids. So, she will not know anyone when she goes in for seventh grade in school, because we started talking about it. I said, ""Well, most likely you'll be going in, because you guys can't stay remote forever.""
	And she, herself expressed that, she said, ""I don't know if I would feel comfortable with the schedule, with the noise again, and people I don't know."" So, I foresee that being an issue. And the schedule, they'd have to get up earlier. They can't just leave the class because they're bored, or walk around with their laptop into a different room because they want to get comfortable. They got to sit at their desk all the time. It's a lot more rigid, there's limitations with that.
	But on the other hand, I think having that schedule and having that set routine will be helpful. It's just, I foresee the adjustment period being difficult. And from my youngest, he actually had a lot of anxiety going to school, because of all the issues he was having. He found school being completely overwhelming, and the noise, and the concentration, and the duration of classes was really horrible for him. We would deal with crying spells and meltdowns every single morning. 
	I'm not looking forward to that, and I anticipate that happening. But at the same time, being ADHD and ODD, being remote is not working for him. So, obviously, he would have to go back to school. Again, I may need some hardcore liquor just to get me through those mornings, because that used to be grueling for us every single morning. 
	So, for us, parting with the comfort and the informality, but at the same time, looking forward to in-person interactions, social interactions, because that's getting shunted right now. I feel like they're missing out on that and their development is sliding backwards. Because on the screen friends are not the same as in real life friends. ",anxious
gaming_group,1,4,5,"	I'd like to hear from you a little bit about what was your kids' exposure or experience with gaming before the pandemic? Did you have concerns before the pandemic? Were there benefits before the pandemic? And how has that changed? And what are your concerns, or do you see benefits with gaming? Parent 4, you want to lead us off, because...",4,"Sure. Sure. Yeah. Well, for Parent 4, Child 2, of course, as I said, the seven-year-old, she just wasn't allowed to do it, so it didn't change. And right now, I don't think she really has the time or facilities to get involved in it, because I won't let her when I'm around, and then in school, people are monitoring. So, it's not an issue for her.
	For Parent 4, Child 1, she had started doing that, playing the games and all, but it was just because she didn't have full access to a computer all the time, except just when she was doing homework. It was just, ""Here's your time. Now your time's over. Now you're done."" I didn't really mind. I would have preferred it was something other than computer game, but if that's what she wanted to do, I didn't really have an issue with that. 
	But it's just that, now, it just seems like it's always available. And even, sometimes with certain restrictions, she could find a way around it. Instead of using Safari, which was restricted by the computer, she found a way to use Chrome, and I had to work around that. I called Apple and spent hours on the phone to try to figure out how to block that too. And so, it became a real struggle. 
	I think we've got it under control, but it just does seem that it's just much more focus on the screen. For us, I don't think it's so much that gaming has taken over, because I do have restrictions, but it's just the focus on the computer. And certainly in the time she has, she would go to that. And it's definitely become a social aspect at this point.
	It's like, ""Oh, can I have a come over?"" And then they want to sit and play computer games together. So, ""Dude, you just spent all day on the computer, you could have done that at a come over?

And as far as I know, she's been respectful of that. Maybe she doesn't let me know, but I think that she's pretty respectful of that.

Parent 4, you want to lead us off, because...",5,"It took me a minute to remember before. Well, I mean, one reason is, one of the things I study, and I'm teaching a class on video games now, it's complicated in my house because I am a video gamer. And I knew that, going, before I had kids, that this would be part of our lives. It doesn't mean that they can play whenever and whatever they want. 
	My kids played some games before the pandemic. I had a lot of control though, because they were not, at that point, technologically able to turn on or unlock any real game by themselves, completely by themselves. They could ask for it and I could give it to them or not. I think that they did have more TV access, typical stuff, but not so much with video games, but they did play. I liked that, but then again, I was curating the game, so I was comfortable with that.
	Now, it is, I think I'm still maintaining better control over games than just YouTube access. For me, YouTube is the thing that is everywhere and you can't block it out well enough. Also, it's just, an eight year old shouldn't be watching, 20 year olds, to eight hours a day, just, even if they're not swearing, or something. It's just things that he's learning, that he shouldn't be learning yet. 
	But he does come home, and that's what all he wants. He wants to play Minecraft, Minecraft, Minecraft. It's not a bad game, but he doesn't have any control. I can't set an hour long limit for him that he would respect. Like I said, I do set limits, but I have to be active in a way that's hard when I'm working full-time, and not getting... We're not out of the house enough, still, I guess, to make it easier, because he can't think of anything else to do. That's the real problem.
	If I take it away, I have to take it away for like a whole weekend and he'll start remembering, ""Oh yeah, I can think of, we can come up with these other games."" But as soon as they get a day of playing games, like I sleep in and they manage to turn it on, then it's just moping and, ""I can't play. I can't think of anything. I'm bored."" I guess it's a skill that they're going to have to learn though. The ability to respect limits, but also recognize, make choices.
	""I have this much gaming time, and I'm going to actively choose what I want to play."" He'll do something like, ""But I didn't get to do this thing I wanted to do."" I was like, ""Well, you should have done it before your time right now."" I don't know when an eight year old with ADHD is really going to develop that. I definitely had to give in for a while, when they were home all the time. I had to give into it just to get my work done. And that's what I didn't like about the pandemic stuff.",disgust

They may not be who they say they are. And I've tried to talk to my kids about stranger danger and online safety. 
	But again, when they feel like they've connected with someone, it's hard for them to not... They could give away certain information without meaning to, or realizing to. And so, then they open themselves up and, potentially, the family up for whatever dangs there are. 
	I remember I have to constantly remind them, like, ""If someone's asking you how old you are, if you're a boy or a girl, it doesn't matter. You joke around with them, you don't have to be rude. You could say, 'I'm a dog, and I'm seven in dog years, or something.' Like, 'Well, I'm 40 in dog years.' Make it a joke. Say, 'I'm an alien. I'm a monster.' So they think that you're just goofing around.'''""
	I want them to understand that people may not what they are, but they have this image in their head, of who they're playing with. And it's hard, because we're talking about seven year olds and 60 year olds playing in the same platform. They're all different frames of mind, and different psychological stability, you know? So, I have that concern.
	It's been hard for me to explain it to the younger one. The older one seems to get it, but even so, there's still issues. That's been the biggest thing for me with the games. Aside all the horrible things, in terms of addiction, isolation, ignoring me when I ask for something, and having tantrums when I take it away, but the safety. And understanding that you have to keep in mind that you don't know who's on the other end. ",anxious

But it forced my son to start doing math, because when he's in Minecraft and he has to calculate his resources, even though he says he hates math, somehow, he's able to quickly pick up on how many more resources he needs, what he has, and how much of it he needs. It just becomes second nature to him.
	And I tried to explain to him before, when he said, ""I hate math. It's useless."" I said, ""But you use math in Minecraft."" He says, ""No, but that doesn't count, because that's fun."" You know? It has its positive aspect. Also, my husband is a gamer, and this gives them an opportunity to bond, and they can play the games together. Also, on the days when they can see their friends, they could play the games together among us. When they do a private game and they'll do it together, that's fine.
	If there could be some way to ensure that we're not having such different range of ages play, and we could ensure, in some way, the safety of them playing on, and maybe have more control in limitations, in terms of how much time they can spend on there, I don't mind it. Because, like I said, it has some uses. It forced him to read, also, because he has to read the instructions, you know? Whereas before, he would just walk away.

And unless you're there behind them, they can be on Instagram and whatnot all day basically. And because they hear the teacher speak, they know when to switch back. So I think the distraction was always there but they were not distracted in class so to speak, unless they were allowed to use their phones, which they don't, unless they cheat but it's been not good.

During the pandemic and after the pandemic, that basically was interrupted and I was trying to over compensate for the amount of time being in the house and the lack of socialization with his friends, so the sleeping time was interrupted and it has continued. At this point, basically he goes to sleep whenever he's really tired. 
	One thing, that was one of the negative things that I, negative changes that we're going through since the pandemic. I would say he became more introverted than before. One of the positive things has been his grades. Even though there hasn't been a lot of interaction or he still remains at school from home, so home schooling. The grades have actually improved. He's a high honors, though we did have the option to go back last week, five days a week. I chose to keep it the way it is to finish the year only because he has improved his grades and I want him to end the year with the grades that he has now.

We felt safe that they could be at home and on Zoom and listening to teachers, interacting with friends, trying to be a little bit social online and just being part of the classroom setting. I guess that was positive. I'm actually glad that they're home and they won't be going until September. We made that choice.

As I said, I have seven children, and you can imagine what was going on in this house, seven different devices, eight different devices because my husband was working from home too. We didn't even have them. My daughter runs down, she starts kicking my husband off the computer, ""I'm late for class,"" and he is talking to a patient. Thank God our kids all went back in September. One kid had to quarantine for two weeks because someone in her class got it, but other than that, they've all been in school and we are so grateful for that because the online learning was terrible. My daughter who's five now, but she was four when the pandemic started, a four year old gains nothing from online learning. Even when she went back to school, she wasn't in every day, I didn't put her on the day she was on. I'd rather take her to the beach or take her to the park and give her real-life experiences where she's gaining as opposed to just watching the screen.
	My high school kids hated it, my teenage girls, because the social interaction wasn't there. They were texting in the middle of classes. Someone said to me, ""You're going to let them do that?"" I said, ""Well, they talk in class. Let's be real. They need the socialization."" I did let them text during class. Overall, I don't like to get my kids online, I don't like the texting, I don't like the phones, and it made it much harder to limit it. My 13 year old was ADHD, he was playing Lego during class. He couldn't focus. Some of the teachers were just not understanding at all.

They just stacked on the assignments. There were times we would just spend until midnight completing one assignment because in between, we'd just be running around the apartment, there were just so many tantrums. It's their way of reacting to this pandemic and the sudden change of environments. I get it, but I actually put them into a school. It is structured, but not as negative as what people say.

I think I'm more nervous. Actually, we had a choice of doing remote learning versus hybrid two day versus five day. Being that this is a particular charter school, not all charter schools are the same, but this very good school laid down the policies just last week, and they basically create this model to incentivize the parents to bring back the kids to the school. Now, if a child has an IEP, and mine does being that he has ADHD and speech, so they're saying that the kids with the IEPs have to come back to the classroom. That's interesting for me because I was actually thinking of keeping them remote until he gets the vaccine.
	I'm very anxious to answer your question because my son is very fidgety even though he's on the medication. He's very fidgety, and he's very touchy. I have a feeling you guys know what I'm talking about. It's very concerning to me because we're all so germ phobic. I know that there are some kids out there who get it, and we can't even see, we can't even tell that they're sick even though they're COVID positive. To me, we don't know everything about this COVID virus, and so we don't know if maybe there are some hidden effects on the child that we will not discover until they're older. The lack of full awareness of the science and the epidemiology behind this is what's concerning me.
	Now, I'm actually getting ready mentally to have him back in school. It'd be good for him, although I'm very worried about the EF skills because I've actually been his support helping him organize like, ""Hey, you have an exam. Don't forget. Let's study.""

I do try to put restrictions in terms of, you have to get up by a certain time and if you stay up late that's going to be a problem. I can't tell him how and when to sleep, but I can make him get up and be productive in the morning as much as possible, including giving him a couple morning classes when it's time to help them sign up.

Then I'll go in there later and see it's in his room again. It's a constant battle.

I mean, he's high functioning. He has anxiety, he has auditory processing, a whole bunch of different stuff. But he manages. And before the pandemic, he had his routine of what he did and it was good. He always has to have a schedule and know what he's doing. He'll do anything but as long as he knows it's something coming up, if not, he gets thrown by that. So the whole COVID, the restrictions just made it more difficult for him to figure out what to do with his time. They had all kinds of Zoom classes or sessions. He goes to the [program]. He does Respite Hab. And at that point, that was all he was doing.
	And he doesn't like Zoom. He's very overwhelmed by Zoom. You know how people, even you can see when you go on these meetings. Even me, for instance, I was on another meeting yesterday and I couldn't figure out how to mute myself and my dog wouldn't stop barking. So there are things in the background that he just really won't do any of them.
	His dayhab, thank God, it's a small one. He went back at the end of August. And except for a few days here and there closing down, they've been open the whole time. So for him, that's great. And then my son, Child 3, who has his other issues, being on social media, I mean, he's always been on it a lot before. And during it just became his only thing. He didn't see any friends in person because he was afraid. And I think that's what made him constantly watching these things that were scary and made him afraid. Like Child 1's mom. I mean, not that it's good to hear that about someone else, but it at least kind of makes you feel like he wasn't the only one because it was the scariest thing ever to just watch him go through that. He didn't sleep, he didn't eat. He just was panicked all the time, saying ""I just can't take it anymore.""
	And I think that's what did it to him, going on these sites that he just became addicted to. And moving forward, now he goes out a little bit, he gets together. He's not an overly friendly person, doesn't have that many friends to begin with. So, I'm hopeful that the summer, he'll be out more.

Were there benefits before the pandemic? And how has that changed? And what are your concerns, or do you see benefits with gaming? Parent 4, you want to lead us off, because...",5,"I would not say that accounts for my kids. That's the one thing I have managed to keep control of, because they needed... So far, everything needed me to okay it. It would be great if they could play with their friends, and they let them play one game like that, which was among us.
	Because the chat time was so short that... It wasn't as bad as some of the others. But there are still problematic things that happened, because I played it, like friends that play, it is adults and children.
	And I tried to talk to them about the same thing. About, ""You shouldn't ever give out your age."" And like, ""But why?"" ""It doesn't matter."" I was like, ""Well, because sometimes people can use that information to locate children and kidnap them."" Was like, ""I wouldn't go with them."" 
	And I'm just like, ""Just stop giving away information about yourself."" That's one area I'm very hesitant to give them access to, but the pressure is mounting as more of their friends are doing it.

They're trying but he has OT and he spends more time screaming and crying that he can't do it with her as opposed to actually getting the [inaudible 00:20:08] twice a week. They're now in person, five days a week so that is has been huge. They're more held accountable at school, they can't take their phone out. So at home, I mean, I'm working from home, I have three kids at home, screaming at them all day to get on their computer, make sure you're doing your work, it doesn't work.

",2,"The fact that the kids are going to school, there is not really a lot of remote teaching, they're actually in-person teaching and they have separate remote teachers for the remote kids. So the in-person kids are actually learning. Like I said, my two boys now are in person. They are learning and the teachers are there which is good and they're really getting something out of it, but it's only been for maybe the last month.
