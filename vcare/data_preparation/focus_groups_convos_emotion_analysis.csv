Well, they didn't use it as much. I mean, the teachers would assign some reading or math assignments on I ready and from time to time some homework. But yeah, that was about it. I would monitor how much time they were on Roblox and other things to entertain themselves, but it was easier control them back then because they didn't have to go on as much. I mean, that's what it was.",,serenity,

My daughter was in fifth grade, we would have a couple in Newsela projects, half an hour of homework. But we were in the playground, neighborhood friends, after school projects, after school swimming. A little bit of tablet on the weekends, but there was no internet access and there was no YouTube in my life, there was no Roblox, there was no gaming. So, a very different world.",,serenity,

My high schooler had a lot of his homework that he had to type and word process... I don't know if that's the right word, into Docs, but it wasn't a huge amount. It wasn't doing research, it wasn't hours and hours. My elementary school guy, he didn't have any homework on the computer at all. And my middle schooler had very little, like type this one thing or something like that. It was very little on the computer. And for myself, in terms of my family, I lock the video games so that there was very little access to video games during the week.",,serenity,

There was no YouTube watching, like now YouTube consumes our life. My kids didn't even know how to use the features on our TV, the smart features, they didn't know they could access YouTube on it or anything like that. So it was very controlled and very little. I also had my children in a lot of afterschool activities. My older son was in an orchestra, he also was in a band, theater groups, there was a lot of afterschool activity. A lot of playing outside, a lot of going to the park and all that stuff. Yeah, so...",,joy,

My kids probably had more... It sounds like they did more online than, so far, the rest of them. But my daughter in high school definitely had almost all of her homework... Not all of it because she was assigned in school, but she definitely was on doing homework, I feel like, a good amount. Nothing like now, but definitely was using it. My middle schooler also, but not as much. They both did play games or use Instagram, my daughter was really into Instagram, not as much anymore but definitely games. Now it's just like a free-for-all. I mean, they're in their rooms with the door shut, I have no idea what they're doing all day. I just know that they're doing their homework, getting good grades. I think they're on electronics the entire day.",,serenity,
gaming_group,1,1,3,"How the technology has changed during the pandemic, school purposes and whether it's beneficial or problematic?",1,"Right, exactly, it seems beneficial because it is an important part of your life as you grow older in high school clearly, and in middle school as Parent 4 said, there's some use of computer. So at first it seemed like a good thing, and I'm sure it is a good thing, it's just, like I said, it's just become overwhelming use of technology because they sit in front of it all day. And another thing, this use of YouTube, because I understand teachers post some things that you can look up on YouTube, so you can't block YouTube because it'll be used as a tool for one of those classes they have.",,disgust,
gaming_group,1,1,3,"How the technology has changed during the pandemic, school purposes and whether it's beneficial or problematic?",1,"But YouTube is just this bottomless hole of... I can't even begin, it's just so bad. And transition from looking at your Google classroom or your Google meet and here's YouTube, it's just so easy. And we were not always there, we still have jobs and other things to do, can't just sit on top of them. So this accessibility of technology that has this type of content, like YouTube, that's not beneficial for kids, that's been problematic, to say the least.",,disgust,
gaming_group,1,1,3,"How the technology has changed during the pandemic, school purposes and whether it's beneficial or problematic?",5,"So for us, we only had a desktop and a laptop, which was more than sufficient pre-pandemic. And then everybody needed a device, all of a sudden everybody needed a device Needed to be on at basically the same times so we got one device from school, we bought a laptop, we found an old laptop. It was like the gathering of devices. And then teaching... My nine-year-old, teaching him how to use it, he really hadn't used computers in that way. And so teaching him how to use it. My middle son is prone to migraines and so being on the screen caused migraines and so that caused some aversion because he didn't want to be on.",,anxious,
gaming_group,1,1,3,"How the technology has changed during the pandemic, school purposes and whether it's beneficial or problematic?",5,"The schedules were kind of crazy, like all over the place. And the truth is that it's hard because my 17-year-old, who knew how to do all these things just kind of stayed in his room for months. And it was just... I feel bad saying it, but he was kind of left to his own devices. He wasn't a big social media guy, he has no social media still, but when the only way to communicate with his peers became to use... What is it? Discord, and all these other things, that became the only way to communicate with people. And then it almost, I feel like... Like Parent 1 said, it's like this black hole that sucks you in.",,disgust,
gaming_group,1,1,3,"How the technology has changed during the pandemic, school purposes and whether it's beneficial or problematic?",3,"Sure, when lock down happened my then first grader, the school did a great job pivoting to remote quite quickly. They used seesaw as a platform. I did get two laptops from the DOE because we have a lot of tech but it's all very old and kind of fragile and I'm like, they're going to wreck it all. Nothings insured. We're self-employed and I could just see the whole business being wiped out so we did take a DOE iPads which was a lifesaver. But also, again, we got to one point where the computer teacher did that YouTube... We were not on the YouTube and she sent one link and they figured out, ""Oh, I can get to YouTube from this link.""",,anxious,

They're fully remote, both of them. Neither one of them has a full schedule so I hear my son... Because my desk is right next to his room, and I'm hearing him at like 10:00 in the morning, profanities on a game with his friend. And I'm like, I don't understand, it's a school day. Well, they don't have school, it's in between a break. So it's definitely made our day... Especially since I'm working right next to him, very difficult to try and do my job and be next to him. But it's their lives, they're in their rooms, if it's not school then it's playing games. My son plays a lot of games with his friends, my daughter doesn't but then she'll be on the YouTube also a lot, TickTock, whatever, and I kind of don't see them a lot during the day. Thankfully they do okay so I don't ask... I used to be a more involved and now I'm not really involved. Now it's a free for all.",,serenity,
gaming_group,1,1,4,Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?,4,"Absolutely. If you want, I can finish that. Actually I'm having problems now because my sons school said... We requested, they didn't say it, but depending on the size of the class you might be able to go in one more day. You can only go one day a week now. And I was able to get him in two days. And the fit that I got, screaming at me for five days until that day came, it was horrible. About how [inaudible 00:33:53] the worst, making him go in for two days instead of just one, so I can only imagine what's going to happen next year.",,anxious,
gaming_group,1,1,4,Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?,2,"I'm sorry. My sons, they actually go to school five days out of the week. Initially we were blended and I had the same issues, the same issues with just constantly on YouTube, and constantly playing Roblox. When they were supposed to do their work I would go in and I would see them clicking out of the YouTube window. We received two laptops from the DOE as well, but before it was kind of limited because we had a desktop and we had a laptop. So before they had to take turns going on the computer if they were allowed to. They went on the computer but it was mainly on the weekends because they did play Roblox but not as often.",,anxious,
gaming_group,1,1,4,Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?,2,"But after everything shut down I didn't have much entertainment to do besides television or talking with your friends or Roblox or Discord or whatever. Yeah, it just consumed a lot of their time. My daughter, who is three, I couldn't send her to the babysitter anymore, so she was home with me while I was working from home so I would have to force her to look at YouTube too, or watch the television. So I kind of really felt bad because I had to do that so I try to always turn on something educational, like Sesame Street. But then she started telling me what she wanted to watch after a while, Nick Jr. or Netflix, so that became a problem.",,disgust,
gaming_group,1,1,4,Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?,5,"For me, the months that I tried to work from home with my three kids was nearly impossible, like I'm sure many other people. So out of desperation, in September we decided to put my middle schooler in a private school, so he has been going five days a week with some interruptions when they close school, but there hasn't been that many. Today, I guess I got word from the elementary school that they're moving to a five day week model, I guess in two weeks. But my son has been going for two days a week since October with the school closings and stuff. But he is happy to go. He's looking forward to go. And my high schooler has also been going blended, it's interesting because sometimes...",,joy,
gaming_group,1,1,4,Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?,4,"My son has been on a 2-3 day week model since January. Before that it was 1-2 days a week I think. But between all the quarantines and the school closures because of those two case rules that they had we were in quarantine all the time until... Hopefully going forward it will be better, but we were in school barely, mostly all remote because of all that. But we've gone a few times for sure. My son, he's on the spectrum so he has all these social/emotional issues that usually prevent him from being able to get along with children. All prior to the school year... We did start a new school this year, so in September we went to a new school that we've attended this year, which was a group of 7-8 kids, when he was in person because of the cohorts. So maybe that has to do with an overall positive experience for him on the days that he did go in person, compared to the prior years when he was one of 32 with all these issues that he had that we didn't even address until this year.",,optimism,
gaming_group,1,1,4,Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?,4,"And as a matter fact we just actually got placed in the NES program so hopefully next year he will... Even though it was a difficult decision to make because we just started a new school this year, new school next year, but I understand it would benefit him and sort of tailored to the exact issues that he has. But in terms of him going back in person, it has been an overall positive experience, he is not protesting or anything. He was able to even make some friends even though they're social distancing with masks on and everything. So I was surprised and happy about that.",,joy,
gaming_group,1,1,4,Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?,4,"Exactly. So I think this is actually one of the silver linings for me with the pandemic, is kids that have issues, sort of like some of our children, when there's a big class size and one teacher and all that, they may not have a good experience I may not want to go back there. But so far, in our case, I think due to the smaller class size, due to having a little more, I guess, personal attention from the teacher who is able to expand herself for the seven kids, it was overall good. It was actually better than the years before.",,optimism,
gaming_group,1,1,5,"Any positive parts you would like to see continue, or are there parts that you're really hoping would end as we go back?",3,"The Google Classrooms, since my daughter has very little executive functioning, she has social anxiety and ADHD, just being able to use the chat function since she'll never raise her hand and she'll never ask for help. Using Google Classroom to directly reach out to the teacher and use the chat function has been fantastic. And then when she goes in blended she has more direct contact with the teacher. She goes in twice or three times a week with her cohort. So I like the Google Classroom set up for her as a sixth grader. Also, the smaller cohorts have been great. It's going to be, just to answer the other question, odd when it goes back to 32 kids. But I love that she can send a quick message, she gets a quick response back, and so that communication has really helped her a lot as an introvert and having those issues.",,joy,
gaming_group,1,1,5,"Any positive parts you would like to see continue, or are there parts that you're really hoping would end as we go back?",4,"Yeah, same thing with Google Classroom. It's probably recent, in the past month or two maybe, that we get a daily update at the end of the day for my middle schooler. I at least see what he's doing, which is probably more than what I ever got from him or the school, definitely from the school, before. So, that's nice to at least get a daily rundown of... It might only be a sentence or two each, but it's at least Something. So, that's nice. And I also like that they do get immediate responses basically from teachers if they have questions on homework or questions... Whatever it might be, but everyone is pretty receptive to responding in a quick time period.",,serenity,
gaming_group,1,1,5,"Any positive parts you would like to see continue, or are there parts that you're really hoping would end as we go back?",1,"So my son, Google Classroom, it was not a good experience because he would not put his camera on, he would just hide behind his camera. He would not participate. He did not reach out in the G chat message or whatever. So that part has not been working out for us very well. However, someone had an idea that I overheard, and so I found a tutor, just another teacher from another school who does tutoring. And so the ability to have tutoring at your fingertips without having to commute or travel, or go and wait and sit there in the car has been... And not just that, but the ability to one on one connects like this.",,serenity,
gaming_group,1,1,5,"Any positive parts you would like to see continue, or are there parts that you're really hoping would end as we go back?",2,"I mean, now that they're going to school five days a week they don't need to use that. I think only the children who are remote use it, but I didn't really like it, it wasn't intuitive and I wasn't able to view the assignments, both of their assignments to make sure that they did it. And then some things they were able to do online, but somethings they had to print out, so it was kind of all over the place. So yeah, the only thing I would appreciate that they continue doing is using it as a way to communicate with the parents, that's all.",,optimism,

She does other stuff online and is on there a lot, but as far as gaming, no. My son, the only positive thing I guess about it is we don't fight about it as much. I used to have to... It's not necessarily positive, it's kind of contradictory, but I don't even tell him to get off anymore. It used to be a fight because I used to have to tell him to get off, now we don't... So the fighting has actually gone down. The flip side of that is he's just on so much more. The language has got worse on the game and I'm constantly having to stop it. But he also has gotten a little closer with some of his friends that he can't see anymore because they're online talking. And the moms and I will say, ""Did you hear they did this,"" if there's a problem. I mean, he's definitely playing more, but he played a lot beforehand too, not like this.",,disgust,

Then after I realized that there's nothing else for him to do... I mean, at one point he had a broken ankle so he couldn't even play his sports, even take a walk. Then I'm like, what am I going to...

We didn't have any exposure to that. I can't again, he was seven years old, he's eight now, so maybe it was just a little early. But this year it just blossomed, if it's the right word, he's playing a lot. I think some of it, again, may be my fault because it's a good babysitter. If you're trying to get through your work, we all have jobs, demanding jobs, it's easier to... instead of just standing there trying to control his gaming, you're just, ""Okay, he's busy and I'm going to get my work done.""

I was able to separate his computer from gaming computer. So that works out, so far so good. I limited it, so he plays a little bit less. But in terms of positive, I also would echo what Parent 4 said, that he was able to connect a little bit more with his friends. And again, as I mentioned, he does have issues with social life, he has trouble making friends and doesn't use appropriate language with friends so sometimes they don't want to be friends with him, those type of things. While they play all these video games and they're pursuing the same goal, whatever that goal is in a game, and he was able to connect with them and speak to them, something we may not even have had, had we not been sitting at home without being able to [inaudible 00:53:56].",,optimism,

I would say it was just affecting their attention and they weren't focused so when I would punish them and say, ""Well, now you can't go on Roblox,"" they would get really upset, they would cry.

I'm specifying one of my two children, because they couldn't be more different when it comes to this. 
	For her, even textbooks being online is not a good thing. We still requested paper textbooks for her, because anytime she's on a screen it's never really been positive. Smartboards, and things like that at school aside, because obviously those are technology and I think they're positive. She literally... 
	Our school went to complete Zoom, like most did... although we went faster than I know some districts did. On Friday school was closed and on Monday school was on Zoom. They the whole time had run it the full day, just exactly like it would be in school, which I know increases the Zoom fatigue, but for her... She shut down. She stopped doing any work. She stopped doing anything. She would sign in to her Zooms, but it was like she wasn't even there. She would have other screens open and other devices open. She'd be on Buzzfeed or something else. She would show up to extracurriculars that were on Zoom, but she'd do the same thing. She was not present. She wasn't present in our family. She wasn't present in anything.

I put... all my answers, I put both positive and negative. That was before Covid. Technology overall allows him to be exposed to things before they're mature enough to handle, anyways. That's a negative. Everything I see has positives and negatives. 
	Once Covid started... He has ADHD, so being in the classroom with the other kids was an automatic distraction. The teachers were always, ""He can't pay attention. He can't sit still."" It was always something. 
	Learning at home, I was able to... That first semester, last spring, I was able to sit right next to him. Oh, okay. We're going to work. I'm the power, you know? I was able to show him better habits of learning and work, which he was more independent this past fall. He did better with the computer. I think being out of the classroom and at home cut some of the distractions. He was able to focus a bit better to see exactly what was impeding his progress in the classroom, and what wasn't. That was a positive. 
	I think the entertainment systems, like the Xbox and... The Xbox was just entertainment, because you can't go outside. It was a form of entertainment for him. On a positive note, the phone gave him access to his friends so he didn't feel as isolated. [crosstalk 00:17:22] Those were the positive aspects of [crosstalk 00:17:24]. He's a social kid",,optimism,

Right before Covid started he was doing... it would have been his second semester of his freshman year. He started having bad anxiety, he sometimes gets... in front of people he gets a lot of anxiety... around new situations... He didn't want to finish school. He wanted to take a semester break. He had a thing about being in front of people he didn't know, and not knowing what he was capable of. So he took a break. 
	Then in the fall, when it switched to... the only choice was remote, or online learning, he's like, ""Okay, I'll give it a shot."" He actually was very successful. He did really well. The teachers were... He also only took three classes instead of four or five, to make it easier. The teachers were accommodating, and he was able to go at his own pace. It was better because he didn't even have to... they don't have to show their faces on Zoom. He got a good, positive, outcome. He actually went back again this spring, and he's doing really well. That's where I think, in his case, it was positive to have class online. 
	I would completely disagree for my other two kids in high school. Absolutely not. They take advantage of being at home and having their devices. But anyway... The positive for Parent 4, Child 1 was that he could actually go back to school and not have to feel intimidated or anxious around other people. 
	The other positive for him is, in between this, he also got a job through DoorDash, and now Uber Eats, where he is driving part time. Again, doesn't have to really socialize with too much people. A lot of people just have the drop off deliveries. Enough where he's feeling more comfortable when he grabs the food, or says thank you. It's helped him a lot, and the technology is how he takes the orders. It's all through the phone. He has to correspond through the phone, and if he has difficulties he has to go through their help desk online. It's really helped him become very independent, and very self-sufficient. He's grown tremendously in terms of his self esteem, just doing these two things and having the ability to do that just in the last six months. I guess that's the biggest positive I can say that came out of this. Among other things",,joy,
social_group,4,2,1,For the first part of the conversation I want to just think a little bit about how technology has impacted your children's education. Focusing on the educational aspect. If someone could share how was technology used for education before the pandemic. Did you find it to be helpful? Did you have concerns? Then how did that change once the pandemic hit? How was technology used? Did you find it to be helpful? Did you have concerns? Who wants to start us off?,1,"Then another negative is not getting his steps in, and he's husky. Another thing is not socializing. Not making new friends. When he was in the 5th grade, 6th grade, 7th grade, 8th grade, he had so many friends. I would hear him on the phone... or he would be like, ""Mom, I'm going to go out to eat with my friends from school."" Now that's gone. It bothers me, because now he'd on his PlayStation all the time. All the time. Now you hear him... he's talked to his friends only virtually, never physically, which I believe is important. 
	That's pretty much it. It's hard to get him out of the house too, on a regular day basis. I try to take him to the gym, or take him outside to get some sun. His vitamin D is very low. It just scares me sometimes. I don't know. It's hard to also make him take a vitamin D pill. Those are my concerns. His health, socializing... I don't want him to have anxiety when he's back in the public and everybody's back in school. The rush... the rat race, the trains, the bus. He takes the bus, by himself, to school. That's pretty much it. 
	But I like it. I like it because he has a chance to pass his classes, and I can see everything that's happening because it's right there on the computer",,fear,
social_group,4,2,2,"Now, my next question is as we do start to return more in person and as people are starting to go back to school... What concerns do you have? What challenges do you anticipate your children facing as they go back to school for in person instruction? ",1,"Yes I can say it, because I already have it in my head and I [crosstalk 00:25:38] anxiety of meeting new kids, his new classmates, and the anxiety of making new friends, if they're going to like him. Things that all of us go through as humans, but he's 16. I don't want him to be peer pressured something to just fit in a group. I want it to happen organically, but it hasn't... It's just hard",,fear,

Right now he's in a smaller school, but he's asking when he goes back, can he go to one of the big, huge, schools on Staten Island? I'm worried that if we do put him in a larger school that he'll lose some of the gains that he's made as far as his academics are concerned. 
	A counter to that, I can see the maturity that he has... I can see his growth over this last year, so I wonder how he's going to handle big school, small school, whatever it is",,anxious,

What challenges do you anticipate your children facing as they go back to school for in person instruction? ",4,"Yeah. Again, the younger one I'm not concerned about. He needs to be in school. 
	The older one that I was talking about that has the anxiety... They all have different forms, but the one who is worried about going back to school in the fall and not even sure if he wants to go back. I don't think it's because of the programming. I think it's because of the social component. He went to a smaller out-of-district private school. He knew everybody there. He felt popular. He felt comfortable being around people. Put him in a bigger environment... he's very nervous about that. 
	I've been trying to reassure him that now that he's selected his major, and he only has major courses left, it's going to be the same people he knows. He's starting to see that. They did have to go in yesterday, and they had to go in a couple weeks ago... It's a photography major. He even came home and felt comfortable because he had met some of the people in person. He's like, ""These people, some of them have all four classes with me this semester."" He's finding that some of them are probably going to take the same classes in the fall because they're only offered in the fall... certain ones.
	I'm hoping I can coax/urge him, encourage him to go, but I do see he keeps putting it off. He's like, ""I don't know. I'm not really sure. I haven't decided what I want to do yet."" He's 20. You want to have him make his own choices as an adult, but yet he's an immature 20 year old, an inexperienced 20 year old. I almost feel like I have to push him in the direction... not that I want him to go, necessarily... but where I think he's capable of going but he doesn't quite see that yet. That's the challenges that I have",,optimism,
social_group,4,2,2,"Now, my next question is as we do start to return more in person and as people are starting to go back to school... What concerns do you have? What challenges do you anticipate your children facing as they go back to school for in person instruction? ",5,"Okay. I have three children. One of them just turned two in March. He's not going remote learning, but he does use his technology. He already has a tablet. He already knows how to work everybody's phone. FaceTime. All of that. With him alone we used to get up, ""Let's watch channel 13, Sesame Street,"" educational programs, stuff like that. He's like, ""No."" He needs his tablet to do his homework, is what he tells us. He needs his tablet to do his homework. What he's doing is mimicking everybody else, because he sees everybody else with a device, and doing something on the device. 
	My daughter, she's 10. She goes to [Success Academy 00:33:15], but she's been doing remote learning the longest. Success Academy were one of the first charters to go remote, even before the Mayor and everybody else was going to do the remote thing. They stopped the kids from coming in. They already had them going remote. My daughter's 10 and she's being doing remote learning for about a year and a half now. 
	I feel like it's counter productive, because I have to obsessively stay on her back. Where they give the kids a itinerary that they want... like when you go to college, you get your course itinerary. You got to go on. You got to be responsible for doing your assignments and turning them in on time. Stuff like that. That's how they're running the program. I feel like for self starters... for kids who are on the ball and you can give them directions and they can go follow them without anything... it's good for those types of kids. If your kid guides off for five minutes or gets side tracked, it's counter productive because you got to stay on they back. I have to know exactly what you supposed to be doing so I can know if you're not doing it properly. Stuff like that.
	You got these kids staring at a screen all day. They're doing Zoom in class, but they not staying attentive",,anxious,

That was definitely a huge adjustment. They definitely weren't able to attend as well as far as school. Their screen usage rally picked up. It was because now they had a screen. My kids, before then, didn't have access to screens in such a capacity. I don't have that many screens in my house. I only have one TV. Only two of my kids have phones. 
	There wasn't this intense access and awareness of what they could be doing on a screen until Zoom started. Zoom was incredibly difficult for all of them to keep up, to study, to learn, to know. They didn't know what was flying. Like the mother that just spoke said, I had to be on top of everybody's Zoom. It's six kids. It was impossible for me to remote work when I was supposed to be working. 
	This year my kids are all in school. They go to private school. They're all in school. Save for a few quarantines that they had to go through, the school did go on Zoom for a short while. The goal waS to get the kids back in the classroom. The screen situation didn't really get much better. They feel more comfortable communicating on a screen, now, with their friends. They need to FaceTime. They need to Zoom. They actually Zoom in groups with their friends now. If they study they can't study on their own. [crosstalk 00:38:12] ROBLOX.
	My 11 year old is definitely by far the hardest of all of them. She went from being on a computer and being a watcher to becoming... ROBLOX is the thing that she wants to do all the time. She'll grab my phone and say, ""I want to text my friends"", but inevitably she ends up doing a gaming. I hate it. Then she says she's gaming with her friends. She'll game and then FaceTime at the same time. No one else plays ROBLOX but her. I don't allow her to direct message anybody or accept anybody's messages on ROBLOX. That became a huge... it's a battle. There's no saving from that. I don't allow social media for my kids. It just... everyday.
	There came a point a few weeks ago I actually removed all the computers from my house, because they don't need to be on Zoom. They're not on Zoom... My 11 year old has to deal with it. I don't like... I literally took... We had three laptops, I sent them to my husband's office. I said keep them there. I told him he's not allowed to bring home his laptop unless we really have to do work.

Before Covid, and now, he's not so much prone to pick up the computer to do anything, make any transactions, scroll, or anything like that, but the phone... When we gave him the phone, our cell phone carrier has an app that we have on our phones so that we can control what he can access. We still have that in place. It has a bedtime on it when you can't access the internet. You can shut down sites one by one where he can't access. We've still had to do that. 
	The good thing about social media is that during Covid he could still have access to his friends... that he could talk to and still share life with. I found it to be a positive for him",,serenity,

I believe her name was miss Parent 6, that spoke after me. When she mentioned her 11 year old and the ROBLOX... Oh my goodness. Before Covid, social media for my daughter was a reward. Like, ""Oh mommy, I finished doing whatever I have to do. I took care of my responsibilities. Can I use the phone now?"" I would give her the phone, and she would be able to, ""Can I make a TikTok? Can I do this, can I do that?""
	Now, because you have to have a device consistently, to me, it slightly took away a piece of my control level. Now you're on the screen all the time, you can just click and I don't see. I don't see what you're clicking. I don't see what you doing. I don't see what you looking at. I don't see what you watch, because I'm under the presumption that she's sitting at your thing and you're doing your work. You're looking at the screen because you supposed to be doing your work, your homework, your this or your that... but you could be looking at the screen and guiding off. There's been a couple times she was in class guiding off, and the teacher's now texting me, ""We're doing math and [Genesis 00:43:55] is trying to get on Instagram."" 
	I feel like it changed the dynamic of what they're doing. Like, what do you mean? I need the phone. I need to be on this, and I got to be on that. I got to check this now. I'm like, none of that is important. What's important is did you do your work? Did you check your work? Did you submit your work? After you've done that, you can have free time to do what you want on the phone. You want to play ROBLOX... they even incorporated that in school. 
	In school there used to be a little time for them to get a reward, or maybe to play a game, something like that so they could interact with each other. Now they got it on the phone. Now they got ROBLOX club. They got this, and they got that. Now when they give the kids the 20 minutes-30 minutes of free time where the kids could be inter... even though we're on Zoom... I could've done a class, or play a math game. They do that once in a while. 
	Now everybody's in a breakout room, and you guys got 30 minutes to play ROBLOX together. I feel like it's taken over. [crosstalk 00:45:23] I feel like there's no separation between the time to what you supposed to be doing certain things",,disgust,

I've really noticed the change because now the two year old, the baby... Whenever I put my phone down, he picks my phone up. He don't call it ROBLOX, he says, ""I want to play Mario."" He has my phone, and mind you, my phone has a password on it and everything. The baby picks my phone up and somehow he gets in to ROBLOX every time. He be playing ROBLOX on my phone.

I also consider WhatsApp social media [crosstalk 00:47:10] They have this intense pressure. I have a 16 year old and a 14 year old. I find that... We all grew up without phones so we understand what it is to be home, and not necessarily have to communicate to the world every little thing we're doing. Every little thing that we're eating. They find this intense pressure to be on all the time. All the time they have to have something relevant, something that's cool, something they're eating, something they're showing, a selfie. I find it endless. 
	It definitely became worse now, because during Zoom they were spending all that time in their room. Now they're still spending all that time in their room. I'm like, can you come up? My two oldest girls, their rooms in the basement. I'm like, ""I need you to come upstairs. Come out of your room, and put your phones down."" 
	I actually started a new policy with them that they need to charge their phones in the kitchen because they're not sleeping. Even with all this screen time boundaries that I put on them, somehow they manage to do something or other. One of my daughters actually... I'm Sabbath observant, so we don't use phones Friday night to Saturday night. We do not touch our phones. We don't turn on our phones. We don't use electric. We don't use television. We don't use anything. It's actually the biggest blessing in the world because it's a religious requirement. We're bound. We don't do it. It's something that... We all are able to release our phones because it's from birth. I don't use my phone on Friday night and Saturday. I find that on those nights, there's so much more... There's just so calm. You can see there's less pressure on them to have to connect. We never connected like this with society when we were kids. We run home we did our homework. We could barely get the phone because our sister was on the phone. 
	[crosstalk 00:49:24] that negative where we couldn't use the phone. There's lot of battle. It's a lot of battle. The minute that my Sabbath ends, my 11 year old is on some device, coming to me saying, ""Can you please unlock this device so I can use it?"" I worry about how they're going to turn out, because I think that these devices... you said something about the good about social media.

At some point, it entertains them instead of me having to entertain them, especially during the beginning of Covid when they couldn't be with their friends. Right?
	My neighbor kept making fun of me for how much time I was spending outside playing basketball, doing relay races, collecting golf balls, and doing other things to keep him busy and off his devices. At some point, I have work, I have dishes to wash, I need five minutes not entertaining anyone, so okay, you can use it a little bit more. Then there are those ridiculous streaks that they have on some of these things. Where they have to and a message on Snapchat every day not to break the streak. He'll sit there just on streaks. This is my... the one who uses devices less, watches the Simpsons while he walks up and down the steps, and then has to get on social media to talk to his friends about a particularly funny part. I'm like, ""You're going to fall and get killed.""
	A lot of the fight is not left in me after them being home for over a year. You know what I mean? I'm wondering if it's even going to be possible to pull back to where we were before Covid, when they go back to a more normal life. Have you loosened the restrictions and it's so much harder now to tighten them again? They don't see that it's not good for them. You see it. You know, but sometimes you just don't have the energy to do anything about.

She follows every anxiety Instagram page there is, and thinks they're the wisest [crosstalk 00:52:27] come from that. Again, I've locked my phone... or her phone... for screen time and things.

	I found a video in my phone of my daughter crying because she could not find her telephone. She was like, ""The baby had my phone, and now I can't find it."" She was so utterly distraught. When I was your age I didn't even have a phone. We didn't grow up with cell phones. You're addicted to having the device itself. ""Let me take a picture of my food. Let me take a picture of this. Let me make a TikTok right quick. Let me say that we're going over here."" Put the phone down. You can't even eat food without the phone in your hand. I tell them no devices at the phone. Like miss Parent 4 said, we in the same house. You texting me from the back room? What is wrong with you? 
	It's becoming an obsession. I feel like our generation, we didn't grow up having the phone. I remember I used to have to ask permission to even use the house phone at a certain time. That was after you did all your chores, or you did your homework. You know what I'm saying? It wasn't just picking up the phone, using it.

I know they circulate pictures of young ladies. I've talked to him about... that would be considered trafficking, which is a felony. [crosstalk 01:00:49] tried to warn him about that and called one parent about her daughter. They're sending pictures back and forth which leads to bullying and all kinds of trauma and drama.

[crosstalk 01:01:34] Colleges will see it, jobs will see it, friends will see it. It's never going away. You have to be very thoughtful and careful what you share, which is a hard lesson to teach them. And if you discover they already did something not really smart, it's there already. Right?

Which I forgot to say about Child 3 who's the one I'm speaking most about today, is diagnosed with OCD and anxiety and stuff like that. He's 18, like I said. I am thinking of having him reevaluated because I honestly think he may be on the spectrum due to some of his behaviors. But anyway, so what I wrote down is positive is that he can stay in touch with his friends, he can play games, use his brain a bit, and have schoolwork. Negatively is that he's constantly on his device. Really doesn't want to leave the house much at all anymore.
	And the worst was over the summer last year he, I guess, I don't know if it was from being on the computer or his phone, but he almost had a breakdown or I honestly thought we were going to have to admit him to a hospital because he became obsessed with thinking that he was cursed. He was watching these videos with people would say, ""If you see this doll or you look at this thing, you're going to be cursed.""
	He's always had issues, but this was, I mean, honestly, very bizarre for him to be out there with that. We had to get him psychiatric help. And he started taking medication. And now he sees a therapist and a psychiatrist and it just, like I said, he always had issues, but I think the whole Corona being stuck in the house and by being on, therefore then, the computer and his phone so much, I don't know what it did to his mental state.

I can say some of the positives, but then I want to segue into what she was talking about because I found some of the same things. So Child 1 is my youngest of the six boys we have. So he was here by himself because he has health issues, so exposing him to COVID was a real concern. But one of the positives of the computer was that he could at least talk to people that were his age. He had something to fill the time, because filling all those hours was nerve-wracking for me. And sometimes you would hear him laugh and stuff, that would you bring joy.
	But the thing that happened with Child 1 that we had never seen before was that he also became obsessed that there were vampires and that they were going to come get him. And all of the same things that, I forget the woman's name that was before me, I apologize. But we saw some of the same things and I was so scared. I took all the technology away from him and he got better. So I don't know what that is online. And I'm an older mom, so I don't know as much about technology and what they're doing, but it was really concerning for me and scary.
	And then at the same time, you feel bad because then they're depressed that they don't have anybody, that they don't have anyone to talk to. So that was my input, but it was interesting that I heard somebody say the same things that we dealt with during COVID.",,sad,

I'm going to make a connection to what both of them said, because my son didn't really have anything specific that he brought out, but he was having nightmares and was afraid to sleep alone. So I'm wondering if it may have been something that he came across online. But to give you his positive and negatives, which some of which the positives are actually negatives as well. So he's very savvy, technologically savvy. So that for me was good because I didn't need to help him too much. I didn't have to interfere too much with that. He's very creative. So sometimes when he gets online, he does really creative things. And I thought sometimes it was good for occupying him, just get him out of my hair. I'm trying to work remote and he's here. So that was good.
	The negatives were he's a little too savvy that he can be a little sneaky and a little manipulative with it. And I wouldn't know, because I'm not as savvy as he is. He gets easily frustrated. So if he's playing a game and he's not winning or it's not going the way he wants, he'll start banging things and hitting the computer as if it's the computer's fault.

Was it already problematic? Did you already have concerns? Did they not even use it?,2,"Well, I can start with that. Child 1’s problem was a problem. The only thing he's not very good at because of his cognitive disorder, he's unable to retain any information. So his worst subject was math. I think after a while, once he learned about the calculator, he was just cheating his way through math, which became more of a problem. Now, he's homeschooled and he just seems to use the modern tech, he Googles everything instead of learning. It becomes harder for me because unfortunately I'm in the medical fields. So I'm not able to work from home. I'm not home with him. So he's basically alone most of the day. But that's how it all started before the pandemic. Now with the pandemic, it just became worse because now he's again, Googling everything, using the computers. So he's not really learning much. That's all I have.",,sad,
social_group,4,4,3,What was it like during the pandemic?,2,"Frustrating. Very frustrating. Child 1 withdrew a lot, lost frends. Child 1 is not very social. So the couple of friends that he did have, they just kind of separated. I started to see less and less of Child 1. I mean, we live in a really big house, three floors and there was days where I would come home from work and he wouldn't even come out of his room, not at all unless I went in. And when I did go in, he was very agitated. And I just came back from vacation and I guess a week away from me, past two days, we've been closer. I don't know how long that's going to last. But with the pandemic, he has definitely become very withdrawn.",,disgust,

What are you worried about?",1,"I'll say Child 3, he graduated from high school last June. So he started, it's kind of back to the other question and this one. He started college last fall, which he did. And then he signed up for this semester and he just got so overwhelmed with having to do the computer. He dropped out and he withdrew without us even knowing. And it was at a point where no refunds. He was also getting an excelsior scholarship, which now he will not be able to get anymore. So I don't really know what he's ... at this point, we're trying to figure out what he's going to do.
	I have my daughter as well, she goes to college. She has a couple of classes in person. She does really well though, she loves school. My younger daughter, high school. They're the worst program there right now, because whether you're blended or virtual, everything is virtual. So the kids that go into class go in, but with their computer and a headset and teachers are at home. But I do believe even for my daughter who has no issues, she will be a junior next year and it will be very difficult. Anxiety is starting already to have to go back, even though she's sick of being home",,sad,

So even my son who goes to school two days a week, says that he sits in front of a computer at school with headphones. And some teachers who are there will come into the room. The technology has been both a blessing and a curse because yeah, it allowed them to go to school while they couldn't physically. But now that they're physically in school, I feel like technology is going to play an even more important role for them that I don't want. I think it's really important that they continue learning through a physical means like a teacher. I know technology is a big subject now too. Technology wasn't a subject when I was a kid, but it's huge now.
	But I just hope that they can find a way to really use it to the best of the ability and not just have kids get on it and do what they need to do. Even here at home, you had mentioned the other thing about technology at home and the difference between going back in school and stuff. And I'm actually really shocked that he's able to view YouTube on his school computer. They don't really put too many firewalls up for a lot of things that I would've thought. So while he's in class, if I'm not monitoring, he's got another window open watching stupid YouTube videos, which I hope he's not doing at school",,anxious,

And when I say social media, I don't only mean Instagram, Facebook, or probably the actual social media that kids use these days, because those are the two I know. I also mean YouTube, other chat apps, WhatsApp, things like that. So thinking about those kinds of programs and apps, how did your child use social media or those apps prior to the pandemic? And what were your thoughts around it? Was it beneficial then? And we're going to go through the same question. So I want to hear about prior to the pandemic, during the pandemic, and your concerns for them in returning to in-person school",6,"So Child 1 has been vaccinated and at his school, all of the teachers who want to get vaccinated have been vaccinated and they are back in school. They've always had iPads, so they still use them. I think that being back in school has really helped him. I found during the pandemic, before the pandemic, he'd used social media, which the kids use TikTok a lot. At least that's what I see and Snapchat. And he was using it. But then when I saw during the pandemic, he was using it a lot and using it inappropriately at times, or with people that I didn't want him to be chatting with. So I just used every parent blocking mechanism and I monitored it and he only gets it for a limited amount of time now.
	And on his iPad, he does do that same thing with the YouTube thing. I've kind of let it go because I just can't fight every fight. But I've seen him do that when he's talking to his teachers. I do think it's better that they're back in school. School's not exactly the same. They are wearing masks, of course, and they're trying to social distance, and they have a lot of restrictions. But maybe some of it just is that you get to see people. I know that when I got to see people again, it makes you happy. Being isolated at home with just your mom is not fun. Did that answer it? Sometimes I wonder if I'm not exactly answering your question",,vigilance,

And I didn't let my kids really reach out and use the WhatsApp or Messenger as much, because I was afraid that they might come in contact with people I don't know and I can't stop ... I have three of them, so I can't control all three of them. But I definitely agree with what Child 1's mom said that it's too much out of control.

And he'll move on to the next one, try that one out for a little bit, and then move on to the next one.
	Before school, before COVID, he had a lot more activities going on. So he didn't have as much time on his devices. Now, even he goes to school, but he's home by 2:30 and back on his a devices now. And just playing video games and mostly watching YouTube. He wants to create a YouTube channel. So with that, I'm making him take a YouTube class about what's good about what you can do on YouTube and what's good and what you shouldn't be doing. So it's sort of like YouTube etiquette. So, I'm trying to compromise with him but also still [inaudible 00:23:46] be aware that he needs to still behave. Because he has gotten in trouble at school because of technology.
