media_group,3,1,2,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,5,"My son goes to our charter school. Before the pandemic, he was using computers to do most of his work at home. But it was really just about schoolwork. So it wasn't doing anything above and beyond that. I definitely found that it was beneficial because he was able to access more materials. When I think of school books, I don't know, an Encyclopedia Britannica just always pops into my head. I'm like, at least you don't have to walk around with this large book, but now you have access to all of that content and much more. That's kind of the framework that I've always been able to use. But I didn't feel like he understood that at that time. Being able to go on Google and just search, I mean, it wasn't something that he really understood at the time."
media_group,3,1,2,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,1,"It was pretty minimal for school. It was mostly, I mean, they did use some Chromebooks for some projects at school that they share. She was in a public school, she still is. But overall, the use of the computer was mostly to do research, for project-based stuff. And punctually to, I mean, in fifth grade more than in sixth, strangely enough, there's a lot of use of Google Class, submitting essays, and things like that, but it was still very minimal."
media_group,3,1,2,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,4,"My child also had access to the computer before the pandemic at school. He also learned [inaudible 00:19:59] at school. It was somewhat minimal. What I love then was that he would come back home, and use the computer for his assignment and most of his thing, and then he was more confident using the computer than writing. And I was trying to get him an access or get the accommodation for assistive technology for him all through the pandemic. And while working, they had to evaluate him and saw that it was more better for him to be on the computer, to use computer for his academic work more at school because it wasn't restricted somehow with the use of computer at school.
	But when he got home, he did everything on the computer. And also, not just for academic work, he also did it for his games and every other thing. But when he transitioned to remote learning now, he's also gained confidence, independence in using everything on the computer. So that's why I say it's half-half. The other half is no. It's complete reliance on the computer. Now you can't get him off it, you can't tell him to stop. You give him a time, he [inaudible 00:21:23]. They will scream and shout. One time he stays until 2:00 AM on the computer trying to [inaudible 00:21:37] and do it ..."
media_group,3,1,2,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,3,"My son before the pandemic was mostly iPad for his ... He had an accommodation. So he would use the iPad occasionally, but nothing crazy. I mean, nothing obsessive. Since the pandemic, it has gone to zero to 100. As soon as they closed the school down, as soon as de Blasio said, ""School's closing,"" it literally went from zero to 100. It's just like he's obsessed with it. Very similar experiences to Parent 4. He does not want to get off of it. It is a constant fight. It is a constant battle of putting in appropriate guidelines. It is a push and shove it. I feel bad some days because I'm like, ""You can't use it except only for school."" But then at the same time because of the pandemic, that's how he socializes a lot of time with his friends. So it's almost like, ""Well, do I punish him by taking away the one thing he really holds most dear to his heart? But then if I do that, I take away his ability to socialize with his friends."". It's a very tough seat. I'm like on a seesaw. It's constancy seesaw, it's a constant weighing the pros and the cons. He's a high functioning ASD. He's got essentially Asperger's and ADHD so he gets hyper-focused and very upset very easily if his hyper focus if it's cut off. No matter how many minutes, no matter how many stop watches, countdowns, the whole nine, it's very trying. That's why I have these bands."
media_group,3,1,2,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,2,"My son's older through all these kids, but he's still trying to get his diploma from high school. He had a lot of issues on top of the ADD, he had some depression, and PTSD. We recently moved out to Maine. So now we're out of New York City and we're in the country. When he was in New York City and school's opened, being accepted to use the computer to hand in assignments, answer emails from teachers, that kind of thing. So he spends a lot of his time on the computer with gaming.Technology has always been his thing. One, I think it just gives him something to do. That takes his brain away from everything else that's going on in his life. But school-wise, there was in-person learning so he didn't ... The transition to in-person learning, I mean, strictly computer learning has been difficult with him because he's actually a social kid. I think so beforehand, so when the pandemic first started, he was like, ""This is awesome, because I'm an introvert and now I don't happen to see people."" [inaudible 00:25:58] really quick. Now a lot of his stuff is he communicates with school and teachers and advisers, friends. I mean, again, there's a lot of online gaming that he does and he actually even streams movies and television and stuff.It's always been hard for him to regulate that. Now that he is an adult and taller and stronger than I am, it's hard for me to kind of step in. I can't move on or just physically take it away from him.He has a job, which has helped. That's gotten him out of the house."
media_group,3,1,2,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,1,"I don't know. It's been ... I mean, because she was remote for a certain time ... I mean, it was horrible.It started well. And then it went to [inaudible 00:28:05] so much more that ... I mean, with her psychiatrists, we had to decide to use medication because it was too much. Then she was on blended learning, which ended up being remote for most of the time. Interestingly enough, the blended time was horrible when she was at home because it was asynchronous learning. So the fact that she was not engaged with a teacher and had to work independently using tools, I mean, we had to spy remotely on her computer because, I mean, it's Netflix, it's anime. We're in anime Japanese World 24/7 so much that she would even hide the laptop under her bed so that we forget about it and pull it out at night. We'd find her in the closet in the middle of the night watching anime. And she said, ""I don't remember. I must have been sleepwalking."" Those times were hard. I don't know if it's maturity. I mean, it's hard. The remote school thing, I mean, it's constantly needing to juggle between trying to get her to be independent and also have her accept that we're still her parents, and we have to be teachers at the same time. We're in that really weird role of having to do both. Overall, I mean, she's a trooper for most of the time and medication had helped with the crisis and the fact that we put a doorstopper, like one of those remotes so she can't slam the door anymore and break the wall, all of that helped. I think the combination of both. I think the crisis, the pandemic coupled with so much screen time, the need of escapism, I don't know who brought that up earlier that, all of that combined with her anxiety was a wonderful melting pot. I mean, now it's much more under control. I mean, it's not perfect, but at least she doesn't have crisis as many, at all."
media_group,3,1,2,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,6,"Okay. I have an 11-year-old boy who is in sixth grade, and I have a seven-year-old girl who is in first grade. Prior to the pandemic, I don't believe that they really use too much of the computer before for schoolwork, because they just had live classes. If they had to research something, my son, but not really, my daughter, too much. And the only time they ever really used gadgets and electronics is for pleasure or after school. But once the pandemic started, he came home with a Chromebook, and this is the end of it for us.
	My son is ADHD, he does not take any meds. But I was fully remote with them when it started and was able to sit and watch these classes go on. At first, it didn't seem like much. It seemed like it was actually working with him, to helping him kind of some of the issues he was having in physical form in school he wasn't having so I thought like, ""This is good. It's working for him."" But that was not true. Like the other woman was saying how they would submit documents or the homework, and it would be submitted and you think it's done, the thing is blank.I realized that all these assignments, I mean, it was a huge issue because he had 16 assignments that he did not do in his strongest subject, which is even worse. It was dribs and drabs of many things with half of the work. I find that they've gone through so many changes as far as technology goes. Just being on it all day and then being on it for pleasure. I don't know, for me, I find that although I am handling a kid who is just starting puberty so I know that you get a lot of other things that come with that as far as friction with rules and stuff. We've argued more than ever, ever before. It is a constant argument about like, ""It's so easy to work. All you have to do is show your face, ask a question, and submit the work."" 
	The grades are watered down. I feel like the technology has just they justify the scheduling as though when you look at it like, ""They're going to have two hours of live Zoom."" But the two hours of live Zoom is just live. It's not the 10 hours or the eight hours that they spend a day on it to do the work, to do the Zoom, to do the rest, and then everything else. It has not been good on this end. For him, especially. For my daughter, not as much of an issue. But for him, yes. 
	And just to note, they've done remote, they've done in school, which they called kind of a hybrid. But it's still remote. It's still remote in a building. It's not remote in your house, because they're doing it off the computer. It's not like they're having live actual instruction like they used to. They're still with the same overstimulation and everything else that goes along with that. I haven't found anything really positive to say about it at all"
media_group,3,1,3,what do you anticipate as people return to in person. Do you have concerns? Is there anything about the educational technology would like to see continue? Is there anything that you hope will end?,3,"Okay. Real quick. Both my kids, my son is ADHD and ASD, my daughter is ADHD and learning disabilities. But I had to make the choice because of the sentiments that everyone said, I had to make the choice to put them in Catholic school this year, because I needed him to be in-person at least five days a week. And that was a financial decision that was not taken lightly. I actually found probably one of the cheaper, less expensive Catholic schools to put them in for five days a week. And even then, there was still points where he was fully remote because maybe someone was self-professed positive test for COVID. He actually tested positive for COVID as well so he was fully remote for three weeks, several times since September, we've been remote. So it's been very difficult.
	Even in person, it's still very difficult. Because he still has people who are also remote in his classroom so that's also a big thing. That's also another distraction for him in class. So that's a different type of distraction. He's getting in-person but there's other kids who are being remote. So that's another distraction for him, which is another ball of wax. That when it's to distraction, he comes home, like today, he came home and it was obviously a very bad day for him because it was a very bad car ride for me. It was bad.Exactly. My daughter, she even goes to a charter school and they were remote three days and in-person two days. Now they are remote one day, in person four days. But she has her own paraprofessional so it's a little bit easier for her but she gets overwhelmed. Her ADHD is more of the impulsive. I think I chalk it up to her being a girl. She's not as much as emotional as he is. He's very emotional. It causes a whole different ball of wax because like I said, if he's had a bad day at school, we are all going to have a very bad day at home. "
media_group,3,1,3,what do you anticipate as people return to in person. Do you have concerns? Is there anything about the educational technology would like to see continue? Is there anything that you hope will end?,1,"The return to school, I mean, right now, she's three days one week, two days the other week. That's been really awesome and nice. She's really happy every time she comes home, much more cooperative, it's still difficult to get her out of bed. It's awesome when she's in school for all of us. She keeps saying she miss being home. The concern I have is that where I'm hoping we're going to be able to go back five days a week. But the two concerns that I have about really as more and more kids transition to going back fully in school is addressing any form of, for lack of a better word, PTSD. I did bring it up at the school as part of the SLT to what are they going to do for social and emotional well-being of the kids when they go back to school.
	The other thing that I would like to see taught in school is form of online ethics. I don't know. The fact that kids trust so much what they see and read online, and it would be great if there was a class about helping them learn about cyber security, being able to recognize on their chat rooms when there's possible grooming, phishing and all of that, and understanding that there's no privacy once you're online. It's not private, it's public. So all of that is something that, especially after seeing what ... They communicate in so many different places online and I can't control all of those chat rooms. There's [inaudible 00:47:18] publicly know that. And I think for their own safety, I think it would be great that ...My biggest concern with returning for my child is ... Like I said, I shared a little bit earlier is how he's going to be able to control his body. Again, when he was home, I'm not restricting him as far as controlling his body. But at school, they consider it as safety issue because if he's tapping or he's putting his pencil on top of ... I mean, there's plenty of chairs that my son has broken while he's been ... Folding chairs that he's broken because he's lean back on them or things like that. But that's home. School is a different story, that's a big like, ""Oh, my gosh, that's so insane."" I'm really worried about that and how that transition from being ...
	And then he also hasn't been out as much, either, because he's been so bogged down with schoolwork. So I'm worried about the overstimulation because even for myself, my youngest starting into school, so I started to drop her off to school and pick her up. Just the fact of me going out for three hours a day, I come back so tired because I feel like I'm so overwhelmed with everything that I had to pay attention to and monitor that I didn't have to do for a year. So I'm concerned of how that if it's bothering me as an adult, I can only imagine how that's going to reflect on them."
media_group,3,1,3,what do you anticipate as people return to in person. Do you have concerns? Is there anything about the educational technology would like to see continue? Is there anything that you hope will end?,4,"I would say my son's school is not going back this session. They are going to be remote throughout this session, because he goes into charter school. Doing good independently. Unlike before, when he goes to school, he is not writing any notes, he's not doing anything. I get all these phone calls, emails. He has to come back home, I have to start writing, I have to start the homework, helping with most of the homework. Type it or write it in his notebook, because some of his teachers will insist that they want the note and it has to be updated. So I have to just write the note for him. He's back, less work for me now because he works independently, he's able to do his homework on his own on his computer, turns it in at the right time. I don't have to do all this paperwork for him. But my concern is now when he goes back to school, to him, he doesn't want to go. He wants to stay remote. He prefer in remote because he's able to do his work and is able to get ...He wants to stay at home because he's able to do his work better and turns his own work faster. It doesn't have to do with all this side things like bullying, maybe harassing and the treatment from all those mates at school. He's in his pace at home, he moves around. Although he gets distracted sometimes. Just YouTube while the class is on, so he gets ... The teacher calls him, he's fumbling on his [inaudible 00:49:40] to respond and all those things.I have to go back to ... We'll be writing most of the time [inaudible 00:49:47] close to him. And when the teacher [inaudible 00:49:53] the teacher talk, put on the volume so I can hear and know when they him and just direct him and assist him. So going back to school next session is a problem that he doesn't want to think about for now. Because since the pandemic, he refused going anywhere. He doesn't trust anything. He doesn't even trust the vaccine. I told him I took the vaccine, I'm okay. He still does not because it was too fast to develop the vaccine. He's autism with ADHD, anxiety from depression, and all of those things with it.
	My concern is going back. And as Parent 1 said, internet safety, very, very important. How will the school handle this when they go back? Sometimes he goes on some sites, and he just gets up and starts screaming and running around, ""I'm scared, I'm scared."" He can't sleep, he can't do anything because of some things that he saw when he was on that site. I have a nephew in England, his age, too, 13-year. And he is all over the world with people that he doesn't know. He also has autism. There was a time he told his mother he was leaving London to go to Birmingham to meet somebody that he had been communicating with on the internet. How do they recognize the good ones from the bad? How do they recognize who they are really chatting with when they're online? This is a very big issue and a concern to me, actually."
media_group,3,1,3,what do you anticipate as people return to in person. Do you have concerns? Is there anything about the educational technology would like to see continue? Is there anything that you hope will end?,2,"My child is on the verge of leaving the nest, I suppose, maybe. He has two credits left to go with high school. He's right now in the process of deciding whether or not he wants to go to a community college or going to a trade. I'm actually looking forward for him being out of the house and coming into contact with people. Because what I've been finding with him is that he has been getting along and listening to erroneous news, fake news, basically.
	Some of this is also just being antagonistic and wanting to be. He just wants to do a reaction. He says something reactionary about everything that's going on from the pandemic itself, from vaccine, Black Matter, Asian sentiments that's been going on. It's just driving me crazy. And he needs to get out into the world instead of being locked up into this little box where he's controlling what information he's getting. That's what I want."
media_group,3,1,3,what do you anticipate as people return to in person. Do you have concerns? Is there anything about the educational technology would like to see continue? Is there anything that you hope will end?,6,"No. I was just going to say one of the things that I think really kind of concerns me is that as he's gone back into the building ... My children go to charter school as well. And they've created so much about wearing a mask, and my son, he's at home, he's not going to wear a mask in our house. So much emphasis on it. Even wearing a mask while they went to recess and his mask fell down a little bit under his nose, and they stopped him from recess and were like, ""No, you have to. Your mask were down."" I mean, some of the things are getting so kind of, for me, a little ridiculous that it's you're breathing your own CO2 all day, getting headaches, all this stuff. If the kid is going to go outside, then let him breathe the fresh air. They don't have to be next to each other. He can run alone, he doesn't need anybody running with him. He has so much energy. But it's like they're getting so ... There's so much more anxiety build up that it just doesn't help. And the thing is when you have a kid like mine, super sensitive, he's very affectionate, he doesn't like ... For him to socialize with the new kids because he went into the school last year. So he didn't even really make friends when March came around. It's like he had no roots. He was in another school for four years. So it's like how do you make friends with people if you don't get close to them? He's a very touchy feely kid. And it's like, ""Now this touchy feely kid was trying to make friends. Now has to be ..."" The expectations, especially when they know your kid has special needs and special attentions and accommodations, that they don't really look at those things fully. And everybody's on someone's scale and it shouldn't be that way. Because I feel like kids with accommodations, those needs have to be met because these kids ... I find my kid is zoning out like things don't matter. And you're talking about a kid who was honorable student. And it's how can this be affecting him in that way? That's all I wanted to say."
media_group,3,1,3,what do you anticipate as people return to in person. Do you have concerns? Is there anything about the educational technology would like to see continue? Is there anything that you hope will end?,3,"I'm sorry, I'm just going to real quick ... I apologize. I'm not going to hijack this time. I was just going to say for us parents who have our children in charter. My daughter's charter is 65% IEP so that's a little different. But other charter schools, that's the thing about charters, that's the gamble. They kind of comply with the IEPs, they kind of don't but that's the thing about charters. We got to take it, we don't have to take it. Just depends on the charter. It's such a hard thing. And I know a lot of folks have just mentioned about keeping track of your kid online. 
	I put Bark on child's my laptop. It's B-A-R-K, it's an app that you download. You have to pay for it but at least it tells you if someone's fishing them. If someone's saying the key words and stuff like, that they send an alert to you. So that's B-A-R-K. I put Bark on my kid's laptop so I can get the alerts. At least, that would be like, ""Okay, let me figure this out."" But it is an awful ... It's such a hard time that we're all going through. Even I as an adult, one of my emails got like I got an alert, alert. It's on the dark web. I'm like, ""I don't even know what the hell the dark web is."" 
	We're exposing to our kids all of these things. And if your child has ADHD or ASD or ADHD with other comorbidities, it's even more difficult. Because it's like it's so hard to protect them. You want to protect them, you want to do what's best. But at this point in time, you don't even know what's best for your child. Because you know the COVID rate amongst kids is less than 1%. Going back to what she was saying about if your child is a social little person, then what are you going to tell them? Like, ""You can't be that social. You got to stay arms away."" But that's so difficult for a kid to comprehend that.
	I's very distressing. I'm not going to cry. But it's such a very distressing time that this is a distressing time for us as adults. It's an even more distressing time for our children. I know one mom just mentioned about the kid not being able to sit still. If that's the case, on your kid's IEP, you can get a sensory cushion and have that with your kid just so they can help. My son, for the longest time, I had him to have a sensory cushion. He was getting in trouble. He was sneaking ... In elementary school, he's in junior high school now, but he was sneaking into the classrooms, into the closets to inhale marker. That's not good. Like, ""Oh, no,"" right, exactly. He inhale marker. Well, that is a sign of anxiety. And I said to them, I'm like, ""When are you planning on telling me this? After he's graduated from smelling markers to something else? When are you planning on saying, 'Hey, your kid has anxiety?'"""
media_group,3,1,4,"any concerns you had about social media prior to the pandemic, how that changed, benefits, concerns, just hearing both asides",5,"I will go first because I have to get off. What social media is starting to ... I mean, he still hasn't really gotten on to it. The kid versions where he's able to connect with his cousins. I've also found that his relationships with school have not been the greatest because he hasn't been able to see them in person. But because he's able to see his cousin, those relationships have grown more. I'm not sure what the correlation is. It's been there. But that's who he's been in this space with. And very early on and a lot of you were talking about some of the challenges with navigating the world wide web with the children.
	One of the things that we did, there was a, I forget, I was trying to see if I could find it, but it was a video that kind of talks about kidnappings and things like that that were kind of happening. It was an actual show, and we sat down and we watched it. We had a long conversation afterwards. Like, ""This is why I don't want you having conversations about where you live or letting even ..."" Because he has a younger brother, I'm like, ""Even being able to communicate."" I said, ""Sometimes your brother might say something to give indicators about the community that we live in, that might lead them that much closer to the house."" So just helping them to be more aware of and be mindful of their surroundings and how the information might be perceived on the other side has been a big point for my husband and I and what we've been trying to relay to him. Because we want to have him to be more autonomous.
	I think somebody was sharing the site, I put on a blocker on the phone and on the computer as well so then I'm getting alerts where he's going to YouTube and some of these things. Because even videos that are coming up that are way too inappropriate, in my opinion, where they're showing crosses, devils, and all kinds of things. That's not something that I want my 12-year-old to be engaging and experiencing at this time. So the social media platform, I feel like has definitely expanded and is now more so like in the TikTok era, in the YouTube era. I know YouTube has been trying to do a lot to try to curb it but it's still not great. So those are just some of the things that I know that I've been doing to kind of manage it."
media_group,3,1,4,"any concerns you had about social media prior to the pandemic, how that changed, benefits, concerns, just hearing both asides",3,"I just wanted to jump in real quick. So sorry about outside. But in addition to social media use, I know that some kids aren't on social media yet. So even if it's just the YouTube or like watching movies or videos, any sorts of media that your child has been engaged in over the past year, definitely tell us about it. And once again, I'm very sorry about outside."
media_group,3,1,4,"any concerns you had about social media prior to the pandemic, how that changed, benefits, concerns, just hearing both asides",1,"So social media, interestingly enough, I think it's been in a weird way better. I don't know if it's because she's maturing. Also, girls start social media, I think, earlier than boys in general. We had talks, we had contracts beforehand. There's no selfies allowed on Instagram. It's a way of showcasing art, it's not about looking how many likes. And it turns out that they don't really use Instagram the way that they were mostly about posting stories. So they're more in the Snapchat, in and out world of showcasing what they like.
	I think it's been really fun, because I can see what she's interested in it in things. And they've been really good conversation starters. Also, it's a great way of monitoring her growth and seeing who she's chatting with. It's been kind of interesting. The only thing that worries me in the social media world is all those. Because I discovered Discord, and then there's chat rooms and games. But there's also, what is that? There's that one game that everyone plays and all the adults love too. I forgot what it's called.Yes. It's been great. Strategy and fun. The only area that I worry the most is YouTube, I must admit, because that's the area where she feels very comfortable commenting on a lot of things, and not realizing that she still comments like a little girl, with mistakes and all that. So that's my only concern, but overall, I find, interestingly enough, a positive experience."
media_group,3,1,4,"any concerns you had about social media prior to the pandemic, how that changed, benefits, concerns, just hearing both asides",6,"I don't think my experience has been pretty good. I think for my little one ... My son is always on animes and looking at gamers showing videos of games and listening to commentary. I think he watches a lot of puppet show. Things I find very silly and immature. I'm like, ""Okay, not a big deal."" But my little one, she likes to watch all these toy openings and kids talking about things that they're opening and she wants a YouTube channel. But I have found that I had to put some blocks on there because I had a lot of completely sexualized, inappropriate things pop up that I was mortified that she was on it and it was ... 
	And her brother noticed it. And I'm like, ""What is that?"" She was on just some kind of kitten. It just popped up. And she, of course, you see something you never seen before. You're going to be like ... And it was so instinctual. She was trying to hide. And I was like, ""How can this just come up out of nowhere?"" There was like nothing that she was on before. I feel like the bad guy because I had to completely stop it. Like, ""No, you can't get on it."" And she said, ""But I just want to see the video of the games and the kids. I want to have my own channel.""
	And I'm just like, ""This kind of stuff. I can't have porn going in front of my seven-year-old. This is highly problematic."" I find that even when you do it and you do the YouTube for kids, it's not even that safe either because there's some anime styles that are just, for my taste, a little too much at this point in time. I feel like they haven't been able to have so much happening. We couldn't go on vacation because of COVID and everything. When it first happened, we had to cancel. I feel like they've lost so much that the one thing they have is the internet. And it's now I have to be the bad guy and say, ""No, you can't be on this."" It's frustrating to say the least."
media_group,3,1,4,"any concerns you had about social media prior to the pandemic, how that changed, benefits, concerns, just hearing both asides",2,"Sorry. I'll be quick. One of the things that I find is that these kids, their attention spans ... I mean, first of all, the [inaudible 01:11:25] kind of problem with their attention span. And with the internet and everything that's on it moves at the speed of light and so quickly. They're getting information that is stunted in a lot of ways. So they're not even getting full pictures. But my son gets a lot of his news from memes. And they'll come to me and be like, ""Mom, this and so and so."" I'm like, ""Are you freaking kidding me, dude? Why don't you watch PBS News Hour with me and get the full picture? And then you can make up your mind and have ..."" It's just ridiculous. Anyway, that's my piece."
media_group,3,1,4,"any concerns you had about social media prior to the pandemic, how that changed, benefits, concerns, just hearing both asides",4,"Let me see. Mine go on these, YouTube videos, watch them. And then Discord, he does Discord so much now. He organizes his own, whatever you call the [inaudible 01:12:19], and when he says something that is obsessing, he comes back and start complaining about it. In the bathroom, you will hear him ranting and complaining and whining and everything continuously. Then I have to stress, ""You know what? You have to stop it. I'm going to take you all. I'm going to take the computer, I'm going to take everything."" ""I'll stop. I'll stop it."" Goes back in that circle and all of those things. I don't know how to stop him. I really want to but I don't know how to stop him. But his cousin is engaged, he connect with other people. And this is it.Because of pandemic. He came too engrossed in that [inaudible 01:13:19] before the pandemic."
media_group,3,1,5,how did your child's use of technology for school purposes changed during the pandemic? Was it beneficial? Did you have concerns or find it problematic? ,1,"I don't know. It's been ... I mean, because she was remote for a certain time ... I mean, it was horrible.It started well. And then it went to [inaudible 00:28:05] so much more that ... I mean, with her psychiatrists, we had to decide to use medication because it was too much. Then she was on blended learning, which ended up being remote for most of the time. Interestingly enough, the blended time was horrible when she was at home because it was asynchronous learning. So the fact that she was not engaged with a teacher and had to work independently using tools, I mean, we had to spy remotely on her computer because, I mean, it's Netflix, it's anime. We're in anime Japanese World 24/7 so much that she would even hide the laptop under her bed so that we forget about it and pull it out at night. We'd find her in the closet in the middle of the night watching anime. 
	And she said, ""I don't remember. I must have been sleepwalking."" Those times were hard. I don't know if it's maturity. I mean, it's hard. The remote school thing, I mean, it's constantly needing to juggle between trying to get her to be independent and also have her accept that we're still her parents, and we have to be teachers at the same time. We're in that really weird role of having to do both. Overall, I mean, she's a trooper for most of the time and medication had helped with the crisis and the fact that we put a doorstopper, like one of those remotes so she can't slam the door anymore and break the wall, all of that helped.I think the combination of both. I think the crisis, the pandemic coupled with so much screen time, the need of escapism, I don't know who brought that up earlier that, all of that combined with her anxiety was a wonderful melting pot. I mean, now it's much more under control. I mean, it's not perfect, but at least she doesn't have crisis as many, at all."
media_group,3,1,5,how did your child's use of technology for school purposes changed during the pandemic? Was it beneficial? Did you have concerns or find it problematic? ,5,"When the pandemic started, they went completely virtual. And they tried, they did, they kept the same schedule as when they were in school, as far as hours were concerned. So his day starts at eight o'clock in the morning and goes until 3:45 in the afternoon. So typically, he'll go until 4:30. So he was pretty much in that space. They were doing 90-minute blocks. So they broke it down to do 35-minute blocks with a break before they went into the next. His level of focus, I guess it was good, because with his ADHD, he was able to make noise and kind of be in his face, and he was on mute so nobody really heard him. He's [crosstalk 00:32:33] stuff and doing things that keep his mind engaged.
	In school, it presents a problem where he would yell out a lot during his class sessions. I'm just envisioning, I'm like, ""Oh, my gosh. This is what you do in class and why the teachers are always having a fit and calling me and feeling like, 'What can we do to get him more focused?'"" He hasn't been taking his medicine during the pandemic. We've had some times where it's almost like a threat, like, ""If you don't focus, I'm going to make you take your medicine,"" kind of thing. Because the issue in class was he'll be in class all day but he wasn't doing any work. So his teachers would call me or they would text me, and there were like, ""He turned in work but it's all blank."" In addition to him having to do his night homework, he also now has to do all of the work that he didn't do for class during the day.
	He's pretty much on his computer from when he wakes up in the morning at 7:00 until going to bed at night at 9:00 trying to ... With breaks to kind of go to the bathroom and eat. It's a lot. It's overwhelming. A lot of times, just like Parent 1 was just saying, we had to do some stop gaps, too. We got the blink camera to put in the room so that I'm able to see or listen or hear. If he's listening or watching a video game or watching YouTube instead of participating in classes, I'm like, ""It has to be something more than you telling me that you're in class and you're not doing the work."" I had him sit in a room and it's difficult because I'm working and it's like, ""Okay, I'm trying to oversee,"" And like I said, I have three kids so I'm trying to [inaudible 00:34:33] all of them in virtual learning. And trying to keep them all up to par in what they're doing. I definitely felt that it was challenging.
	But the good parts about it were that he was able to connect with friends and family members that he wouldn't on a regular basis. On the weekends, if he did well in school, I'm like, ""Okay, then you can spend time with your family."" But that just meant more time on the screen. Maybe on a different type of device. Now, it's the TV instead of the computer. Or maybe it's his, what do you call it? His phone or other electronic devices. But it's still, to me, overkill. And I feel like when he goes back to school, I think it's just going to be much harder, because I don't know what the [inaudible 00:35:27] kind of does that look like. With overstimulation and then they go from overstimulation to something not so [crosstalk 00:35:35]"
media_group,3,2,1,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,6,"So before the pandemic I feel like, especially with technology, my kids didn't really have much at all that they had to do. My oldest is in sixth grade now, so I think that might have changed going to middle school, however, while they were in elementary school, they really didn't have any assignments that they needed technology for, for the most part. So it was rare. And then, of course, last March school went completely virtual and everything was online. So it was like a night and day change for us. It was a disaster, to be honest. Well, really, they're on all day. They're on all day. Now, one of my children is a really unique learner and one of them did okay. One of them was able to go on. But then one of them is really ... He's unique and his teacher not seeing him in person, it affected him. Even this year, for example, he started fully virtual at the beginning of the school year and his teacher, since she hadn't met him and she hadn't seen him in person, she didn't grasp that if he wasn't doing an assignment, it wasn't because ... He has ADHD and if he wasn't doing the assignment, it wasn't that he was trying not to do it, he was just having a hard time and she wasn't there to be able to intercept and to sit with him and to see how she could help him. She wasn't able to help him because she didn't know what the problem was because he wasn't there. Yeah. Now he's back full time and he is doing a lot better. Still, I feel like they're just online all day long and it's a problem. "
media_group,3,2,1,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,1,"I might echo Parent 6 because, similarly, my son too, prior to the pandemic the most time he would spend on any electronic device was either in school for a computer media class and then after school or after homework, he'll have some free time, we call it free time, where he can play on his iPad or his cellphone for a couple of hours before bed. But, I mean, it was a total 180 where now he's fully remote. And actually, it was like a double whammy because I was actually diagnosed with breast cancer in February, so having this diagnosis and having the pandemic and then all of this pressure on my son to make sure that I'm healthy, make sure that he's doing well in school, it did take a negative toll at first. 
	But, again, through reading affirmative things and helping him along and making sure that he sees me in a not just a healthy state but also in a physically healthy situation, it helped him. But literally, his electronic usage went from pretty much nonexistent to almost 200%, because after school he goes directly to his iPad to play. When that dies, he goes directly to his iPhone and then if that dies, then he'll go to my computer to do classwork. It was like a never ending cycle and I have to break him off of it. I would try to have not just physical exercise but mental exercise as well when he's on break and when I also work remotely, fully remote, we would for lunch just go outside, take a walk, just talk about the sky or talk about the birds chirping. Something that we don't have to focus on where it's a problem or it's worrisome. That seemed to help for the time being. But I think when we come back indoors, it's back to the gadgets. 
	I would say his learning, his academics actually improved. He has an IEP. He has-Right. I mean, as much as he's on these devices, he actually improved academically because it enhanced some of his skills that he already had, his computer skills and navigating. He was able to work independently and actually become a leader in his class where he's in the chatroom trying to troubleshoot those who are even having technical difficulties logging on. It'd be so funny. But-Right. Well, can you help mommy record this Zoom? But I've seen and his teachers have also seen a very much more confident student and person overall. Not to take up too much time, but my son, he had confidence issues and wanting to be liked by everyone, wanting to be friends with everyone. But this past year especially, he really stepped up to the plate and actually became the leader confidently and was able to excel. So I'm very proud of him. I'm very proud of him. And I'm cancer free too. "
media_group,3,2,1,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,4,"Okay, great. So it has had a negative impact on my household because it's too much computer time. And I remember those questions when I was filling out one of those questionnaires when I brought my daughter there to be evaluated. It was speaking about the problems in reference to the computers. I'm like, ""I don't have those kind of problems. What are they talking about?"" Now fast forward to this pandemic, now I understand. I'm having those problems. I'm having problems because now she wants to be on the computer all the time and it's hard for me to take it away because she has to do her schoolwork and she's learning remotely. 
	It's hard to sanction that because she'll say, ""Oh, I need to do my homework, or I need this app or that app."" It's just difficult to sanction the time so I have to let her use her computer but I catch her and she's getting in trouble with the computer because now all of these open sites and bringing up conversations that I never thought I would have to have with my 11-year-old daughter because she's on all of these different sites. And here, I'm putting in all these parental controls but she's very savvy so she can overstep those controls and now her and her friend and then teaching her how not to turn over your screen to your friend, I know you think is your friend, but there's so many things that you can get into problems with. 
	So for me, I'm just devastated by all of this computer time. And I have two children, so even the little one ... I mean, they need some in person. They need to not always have to rely on the computer. And that was my problem even before the pandemic because I saw the teachers were moving into having your children learn more with these apps. And sometimes I have to tell them it's okay for them to use pencil and paper because I feel you learn better, at least until you have the concept, then you can do it on the computer. Yeah. I'm not impressed with all of this, everything on the computer. For me, it's just a negative impact. "
media_group,3,2,1,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,3,"Yeah. So before the pandemic, my oldest daughter who was then in eighth grade, she was the primary computer user in terms of schoolwork. But even then, she still had other things that she could use. She had texts that they would send home. She had articles that were printed out already or worksheets or things like that. She has some trouble with writing. She had OT to help her with writing for, I think it's dysgraphia. And it's much, much better now. So the computer, she tended to use it a bit for anything that involved writing and she did a lot of voice to text and things like that anyway, but she did have a lot of alternatives. 
	My middle daughter who is about to turn 11, she hardly used the computer at all. She used it sometimes for some research things if she was working on a project. But most of her work was either done in school or it was done on paper. It was read a book and write a paragraph or something like that. She was then in fourth grade. Then, of course, this hit and they were 100% learning online. 
	It was more successful for my fourth grader because her teacher had it organized. She would give them a checklist on Google Classroom so they could see what they needed to do each day. She would give them a preparation for what was coming up, like, ""Here's what the week will look like."" And she also had live class sessions and she had it broken into ... She did three meetings per day, and one was a morning meeting to talk about the plan for the day, then she would give them an assignment, then she would have them meet back again an hour later to check in about the assignment and do the next thing. And then in the afternoon she did some small group work. 
	Where it was really challenging is that my daughter is in a French dual language program and so, of course, and we're anglophone, so that just dropped. I mean, that's one reason why her teacher tried to do a lot of small group work to try to help build that up, but that was certainly a challenge for us. We had to try to find ways to help her be exposed to the language so she wouldn't lose her ability then for starting fifth grade and then struggling. 
	But my eighth grader, some of her teachers were amazing with checking in and having office hours and doing some instruction and tutoring and things like that online and some of them, it was like they just were phoning it in at the end of the semester and she was teaching herself. And that was very difficult. This year, it's changed because now she's in high school and she's at a performing arts school. It's been a real challenge because her art is violin and it's really hard to do instrumental work with groups Zoom. They've done their violin lessons on Zoom but it was just one on one. But her orchestra class, they really haven't done any orchestra all year because you can't really do an orchestra on Zoom. There's a lag between the things. So that's been a little bit of a challenge. 
	But she's had all live classes online this year, because their school, that's how they set it up. That has been fantastic. Because it's enabled two things to happen. One is that because she does have ADHD and she has a really hard time organizing herself, she doesn't really have to organize herself because she's in the lessons all day. And then she has a little bit of homework to do, but it's not an extreme amount. And they do a lot of breakout rooms and stuff so she's able to do some small group work and it helps her, I think, because she doesn't have to be teaching herself. 
	It also helps because when I'm home, I'm hearing what she's learning in class. That's been really great. With all my kids, hearing their teachers teaching them online, I've been blown away by the skill of these teachers. They're amazing. And the thoughtfulness that they put into their projects and developing their curriculum, it's just outstanding and I feel like that's been a great gift to have that insight. And it's also helped me when it comes time for me to help them, because I can say, ""Oh, no. Remember, Mme Simone was saying that you needed to do this with this project. Yeah. I understand you forgot that, but I heard her say it so let's do that."" So that's been helpful. It's been good. Yeah. The challenge that we've had with mostly my middle daughter is that she also has anxiety and OCD and so she, first of all, can go down a rabbit hole when she's just learning online. Secondly, this year she's been doing blended learning so when she's in school, she's doing all right. When she's at home, she gets almost no work done. I mean, she's been working today and as of the time I came in here, I think she had done one math problem. She just has a really hard time. And I have to see her screen at all times. If I can't see her screen, she's not doing what she's supposed to do and that's [crosstalk 00:38:49]-And that makes problems because then I have a five-year-old, and if I have to look at the screen all day of her older sister, I can't be doing things with the five-year-old. And my five-year-old then spends a lot of time coloring or playing with magnet tiles or watching videos because I have to keep saying, ""I'm sorry it's a beautiful day. We can't go outside. I have to make sure your sister's doing her work."" We've had to do that too. We have to lock them in a room. Would it be all right if I just add something to what you ...Okay. So there were two things that Parent 5 said that reminded me of stuff with my kids. One of them was that the addiction to the screen time is followed by this ... In the beginning of the pandemic at least, we really had to force them to go outside. One of my kids just had a meltdown yesterday because we had to go to in person violin lesson because her teacher resumed that. She says, ""I don't want to go outside. I don't want to go outside."" So definitely there's been an element of ... Once they're out, it's okay but it's like leaving the apartment has become a bigger deal. And one of my kids, she had almost lost complete contact with friends until she consciously ... We both, we planned it out. You've got to start contacting your friends because it just slipped away. 
	The other thing I wanted to say, which Parent 5 was talking about her son's skills with the technology and it's not just the Zoom or the Google Classroom or Google Meet, but my kids have used so many more different types of programs like Flip Grid. They're creating presentations with Google Slides. They're using special effects in their presentations. They're creating videos. The one with the violin, she's working with something called Click Track so that she can coordinate her timing with the timing of someone else's playing so that they can line up their performance videos. They're doing animations for projects. That's been amazing to see that, because they've then been able to use what appeals to them and what works with their skillset and their abilities to do their assignments, because there's a lot of variability in how they present the information and then they've got this array of options through technology to work with and that's been a real gift as well. So it's definitely been a double edged issue. "
media_group,3,2,1,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,5,"Yeah. Well, prior to the pandemic my kids were very exposed to technology. They were using it as well for school. They had a lot of apps for reading. My older son, Andrew, he has a-It was. It was because it was controlled. Whenever I needed to, I was able to put away the devices. But after the pandemic, like another mommy said, I have a problem taking the laptop away because he uses it for school. Now, the negative of it is my older son who has an IEP is becoming more addicted to the screen. If it's not the laptop, it's the iPad, when the iPad goes empty, it goes to my phone. He's just switching from one device to the other. But as far as school goes, he is doing amazing, a lot better than when he was in school. Remote has done wonders for us. He's more focused. He's totally in charge of his school day. I don't get involved. He gets great grades. And it helped us also with the transition. 
	I was very nervous about Andrew going into sixth grade. It's a new school, new teachers, new system. But that worked out so well for us because now he got to know all his teachers and he's doing great academically. He's doing amazingly. So that was very good. It's just that he's becoming more addicted and less socially involved and that's the part I'm not happy with. Yeah. Lucky for us, honest to God, I pray for these teachers. They're amazing. I don't know if it's us, we jut are lucky with the teachers he has. They're very dedicated. He has live classes. I don't feel like he's missing anything. And I also get to see how Andrew is like with his teachers and his classmates. And he takes charge also, like another mommy said. It was funny, I was laughing because he does the same thing. He gives everybody advice on technology. He's like the tech person in the class. Even his teachers, they tell me if Andrew's not there, we get nervous. He's enjoying it. I'm happy to see how he's like and he's doing great. And I feel like when this is all over, when school is over, I can go back to controlling device time, screen time. He's not going to give it up willingly. I'll have to hide devices like I used to before, which is fine. It used to work. So it's good. "
media_group,3,2,2,"some people have gone back in person or you're anticipating going back in person, what are the challenges that you anticipate and are there parts of this that you hope will continue and are there parts of this way of educating kids that you hope will end? ",2,"I'll go. I guess I'm anticipating ... I would like him to go back to school. He's in ninth grade right now. So hopefully he'll be able to go back in person. He does have asthma so that's what I'm really concerned about, just him being in person. But I like the aspect that they can utilize their computers in the classroom. That's a good benefit. But I do like the teachers teaching live. That's another thing. But he needs that social skills. That interaction is what really ... It's just me and him in the house and I think we're both getting tired of each other talking to each other. He needs that input with other people, other teenagers his own age. 
	And I like that the teachers are incorporating all this new technology. He's learned how to type and just things he should have known how to do, and even learned life skills within the house, which is great. Just so we could incorporate all those things when they go back into the classroom. Yeah. If I could just briefly piggyback off of what everyone had shared is my son has been fully remote and I think with him graduating fifth grade, entering a new school sixth grade. That's already some pressure right there and whether or not he'll be in blended learning or in in-person learning full time, that's really dependent on the current environment around September. My son as well has asthma so, of course, that's always his health. His safety is always at the forefront. And my son, again, I had JD as an IEP so he's very hands on, visual type of student who requires that physical in person learning. It's not to say that he can do without, but in a physical classroom setting I feel that now that he's matured and has a little more confidence, he can enhance those skills better in in-person learning. 
	Again, I'm with Parent 5. We all have enjoyed being ... I'm a social butterfly, but I really am recluse as well. And I passed that along to my son. We've been home together during this time, however, it's going to be a change for the both of us. Myself, I'm being called back into work as well. So getting into a new normal, of course, it's going to take some adjusting to, but I'm sure that we can overcome any challenges that we face, especially if we are not only physically prepared but mentally prepared for it as well. "
media_group,3,2,2,"some people have gone back in person or you're anticipating going back in person, what are the challenges that you anticipate and are there parts of this that you hope will continue and are there parts of this way of educating kids that you hope will end? ",4,"Yeah. I will be very excited when they go back in person. The part that the teachers are doing a fantastic job and I have to say they are going above and beyond during this remote learning. And I know one thing they said, ""Oh, my kid is so great. She's so great. She's doing so well. She's leading the class."" Yeah. She is doing a lot of that stuff because she's home with me every day and the teachers don't really have to deal so much with those behavioral issues because now all the behavioral issues are home with me so she can shine with them for the most part. But for my youngest one, she loves that in person and she needs that. For me, I'm working every day from home so to work every day from home and try to teach a third grader and a sixth grader, it's very difficult. So I definitely would love for them to be back in school and in person learning and they can use some of this technology and hopefully the teachers will continue to be as great as they've always been. "
media_group,3,2,2,"some people have gone back in person or you're anticipating going back in person, what are the challenges that you anticipate and are there parts of this that you hope will continue and are there parts of this way of educating kids that you hope will end? ",1,"Hi. I'm looking forward to ... My daughter's about to start five days. She's been going three days, she's been going two or three days, my five and 11-year-old. It's been so exhausting. Well, it's enabled me to see where the problems and challenges are. I've asked for an IEP review because I'm like, ""These are some other issues that I didn't realize were going on."" It's been so exhausting and I haven't been able to do any of my work. As I think Parent 4 eluded to or said, it's a struggle to do anything you have to do when you've got these kids that you have to teach as well. So I'm looking forward to them being able to go into the classroom and do and have their learning more focused there. 
	And for my five-year-old, it's so important because of the social stuff and for my 15-year-old, she's just going to be starting back three days. And she's done really well with being fairly connected to people given that she's never stepped foot in her school. She's in ninth grade. But it's going to be great for her to be able to be there and really to connect with her teachers and with her classmates. What I'm worried about is that ... Well, two things. One, is it gets harder for the older one who needs a little bit more ... Who's not as self directed and so she's then more independent, which actually makes it a challenge for me to keep track of what's going on. 
	But my 11-year-old has so much anxiety, she gets so many physical symptoms of that, that she's had a lot of school refusal in the past. And having it be just two or three days was what kept us going this year, was you can go, you can have that time, but guess what? When she was refusing on a Wednesday, ""I'm not going to school. I feel sick. My stomach hurts. My head hurts."" We would say, ""But it's the last day of the week. Then tomorrow and Friday you're home."" So that was what kept us going. I'm not looking forward to those morning challenges again because I feel like it's going to be a lot for her because she's just so anxious. "

",5,"Well, my kids are not too excited about going back to school and that worries me. Neither am I. I've gotten really very selfish. I enjoy having them home. I love having them home. And the only thing we miss really is the social aspect of being physically in school and the after school programs. I had them registered in chess, soccer, all these activities. But having them home has been awesome. So I think it's going to be difficult for all of us when they start going back to school. "

",6,"I just want to add my kids have been full time for a while. My husband and I are both essential workers so we've had no choice other than we had to keep him out of school. They're really happy back in school full time now. My oldest is now in middle school so he had to wake up early. So he had to get on the bus-He had to leave at 7:00, so that's really his only complaint. Other than that, he said that he's really, really happy to be back in school. They're really enjoying being with the other kids. "
media_group,3,2,3,"what was the social media and media used, and by media we mean YouTube or any kind of media that they're consuming. What was the use like before the pandemic, how has that changed? Any concerns, any benefits that you're seeing from changes in social media use? ",6,"So what's changed with the social media, so my kids, as I'm sure all the rest of the year kids do also, they really like Roblox and they want to play with their friends. So before it was more controlling, okay, you have this amount of time to go on YouTube, you have this amount of time to play. But now, when everybody was home, the Roblox playing with friends and talking on the phone at the same time was the only socialization that they had. That was their only option. So it got a little more and a little more and then they said, ""Oh, well, I'm playing with my friends so can I keep playing?"" So then that time extended a little bit. So it's hard when that is the only way that they could socialize or when they're on FaceTime, when they're going on FaceTime with friends. When that's the only way that they could socialize, that has been really difficult to reign it in and stop them from it. So we've been having a lot of challenges with that. 
	And then the YouTube videos start and that's when everything they have, like their school issued iPads, and so I could take away their own personal devices, but the school iPads have YouTube on them. So I can't ... It's for school so I can't just take it away. So then-they end up sneaking. Mm-hmm (affirmative). It's a lot harder. And sometimes I don't even want to because that's the way that they're able to socialize. They're starting to go to the park with kids and doing more now but it's been a challenge this whole time. "

Any concerns, any benefits that you're seeing from changes in social media use? ",3,"So I've had a very similar experience. My then eighth grader was already on social media because I reluctantly let her have an Instagram account because her class at school, her cohort, had a cohort Instagram chat going and they mostly used it for things like, ""Hey, I have a doctor's appointment today. Can anyone tell me what I'm going to miss in this class?"" For that type of thing. So they mostly used it well. There were some incidents though of kids sharing porn and things like that on it. That was obviously a problem. But this year, yeah, she's used it really ... That, and the other thing was SnapChat that I was like, ""You cannot have SnapChat. Absolutely not. It's like a sexual predator's playground."" 
	And then she had a friend, a pen pal in New Zealand, who she found out was on SnapChat. So then it was like, ""All right."" Kind of like Parent 6 was saying, that's how they connect. I mean, yes, they can write letters but it's so much more immediate and they socialize so much more so I was like, ""Fine, okay. You can use SnapChat."" So it was creeping up. But I think I have to have my rules. I have to have the passwords. I have to have access because I want to make sure that they're safe online. And so I periodically go in and check. 
	My 11-year-old doesn't have any of these accounts. What she has is YouTube and she's become obsessed with various YouTubers and it's prompted some discussions about what we value and what we don't. She definitely sneaks it when she's not supposed to. That's definitely been a challenge. And again, same thing, school computer, you can't exactly ... I mean, she does have to do work. It's been great in some respects because she's been able to use it for school, but also I don't really want you looking at these people and following what they're doing because I don't agree with it. 
	So, yeah. That's been a little bit of an issue. I've worried a lot about body image and things like that with them because I feel like when they're following these people on whether Instagram or YouTube or wherever else, a lot of these people are making tons of money as so called influencers and they have a very different lifestyle. And I feel like sometimes that's hard for them to see. But one of my kids went through a little bit of an issue around food and she was talking about like she wished she could be anorexic because she wanted to be a certain way and we had to have a whole discussion with the psychiatrist around that and talking about positive body image and stuff. And I think she seems like she's on a better path. 
	But I wanted to say one last thing about it, is that where it has been really good is that my oldest daughter, during this time, she seems to be like a lot of adolescent girls are, I'm reading, she's developed vocal and motor ticks, which is one thing I'm worried about when she goes back to school. At home she can hide it from people to some degree but when she's in person, it's a lot harder. But she's actually connected a lot with people on Instagram who also have some of these struggles and she's starting to talk about herself more as neurodivergent as opposed to having a disorder and things like that, and learning techniques for managing it. She'll say, ""Oh, I found out that so and so on Instagram has the same kind of ticks that I do and this is what she does to help herself. That's been fantastic, that it's really enabled her to develop a sense of agency around herself and her managing [crosstalk 01:01:17].Yeah, yeah. So that's been the positive, whereas the rest is like a minefield. "

Any concerns, any benefits that you're seeing from changes in social media use? ",4,"I have to say that my kids, even the eight-year-old, everyone wants to be a YouTuber. They want to be a YouTube star or they want to be famous or Instagram famous and that's killing me right now. Because with everything that's going on, you're like, ""What happened to I wanted to be a doctor or lawyer or teacher?"" Everyone want to be a YouTuber and even the eight-year-old. I'll go, ""What do you want to do on YouTube?"" And she's struggling with, ""Maybe I can open toys."" I'm just so over it. I just feel like I have to get back to basics. And it's harder with the 12-year-old because she's exposed to so much and she's faster than I am with these computer skills. So if I see something I don't like, she can hit two or three buttons and it's done. So I spend the rest of my time going, ""Go back to that page. Go back to that page. I know I saw it."" 
	I just feel like this whole social media, these influencer ... And I didn't even know what an influencer was before the pandemic. I had to learn all of this during the pandemic. And when they see these kids in these beautiful houses and their parents. The YouTubers where the twin girls or whoever, all I can do is watch it and say, ""Hey, their house is clean. You see they cleaned their room. Are you cleaning your room? They make their beds every day. Yes."" So these people are making tons and tons of money and they have all of these toys and these beautiful houses. Like one young lady said, the body imaging. I'm watching my 12-year-old constantly looking at her body and excited about it or say, ""Hey, I want my boobs bigger or maybe my butt should be bigger."" I'm so over it. 
	So even when this pandemic is over and these kids are back in school, this whole social media presence is here to stay. And I have to now navigate it so that I know what my kids are doing. And that whole SnapChat, I had to shut SnapChat down so quick because it's just too much. And the schools don't have SnapChat on their computers so I can say, ""Hey, no. We're not having it."" But the social media presence, I just have to stay on top of it. And with all that I have to do, I really don't want to be on social media like that but I have to. "

",5,"I actually thank you for this meeting because I thought I was the only one in this world that's having a problem with YouTubers. My son has developed such an addiction to video game YouTubers and I freak out. I just flip. The more I tell him not to be on them, the more addicted he gets. Like I said, after school I'm hiding all devices. Hopefully it'll be under control. "
