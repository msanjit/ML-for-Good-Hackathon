media_group,3,1,2,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,5,"My son goes to our charter school. Before the pandemic, he was using computers to do most of his work at home. But it was really just about schoolwork. So it wasn't doing anything above and beyond that. I definitely found that it was beneficial because he was able to access more materials. When I think of school books, I don't know, an Encyclopedia Britannica just always pops into my head. I'm like, at least you don't have to walk around with this large book, but now you have access to all of that content and much more. That's kind of the framework that I've always been able to use. But I didn't feel like he understood that at that time. Being able to go on Google and just search, I mean, it wasn't something that he really understood at the time."
media_group,3,1,2,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,1,"It was pretty minimal for school. It was mostly, I mean, they did use some Chromebooks for some projects at school that they share. She was in a public school, she still is. But overall, the use of the computer was mostly to do research, for project-based stuff. And punctually to, I mean, in fifth grade more than in sixth, strangely enough, there's a lot of use of Google Class, submitting essays, and things like that, but it was still very minimal."
media_group,3,1,2,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,4,"My child also had access to the computer before the pandemic at school. He also learned [inaudible 00:19:59] at school. It was somewhat minimal. What I love then was that he would come back home, and use the computer for his assignment and most of his thing, and then he was more confident using the computer than writing. And I was trying to get him an access or get the accommodation for assistive technology for him all through the pandemic. And while working, they had to evaluate him and saw that it was more better for him to be on the computer, to use computer for his academic work more at school because it wasn't restricted somehow with the use of computer at school.
	But when he got home, he did everything on the computer. And also, not just for academic work, he also did it for his games and every other thing. But when he transitioned to remote learning now, he's also gained confidence, independence in using everything on the computer. So that's why I say it's half-half. The other half is no. It's complete reliance on the computer. Now you can't get him off it, you can't tell him to stop. You give him a time, he [inaudible 00:21:23]. They will scream and shout. One time he stays until 2:00 AM on the computer trying to [inaudible 00:21:37] and do it ..."
media_group,3,1,2,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,3,"My son before the pandemic was mostly iPad for his ... He had an accommodation. So he would use the iPad occasionally, but nothing crazy. I mean, nothing obsessive. Since the pandemic, it has gone to zero to 100. As soon as they closed the school down, as soon as de Blasio said, ""School's closing,"" it literally went from zero to 100. It's just like he's obsessed with it. Very similar experiences to Parent 4. He does not want to get off of it. It is a constant fight. It is a constant battle of putting in appropriate guidelines. It is a push and shove it. I feel bad some days because I'm like, ""You can't use it except only for school."" But then at the same time because of the pandemic, that's how he socializes a lot of time with his friends. So it's almost like, ""Well, do I punish him by taking away the one thing he really holds most dear to his heart? But then if I do that, I take away his ability to socialize with his friends."". It's a very tough seat. I'm like on a seesaw. It's constancy seesaw, it's a constant weighing the pros and the cons. He's a high functioning ASD. He's got essentially Asperger's and ADHD so he gets hyper-focused and very upset very easily if his hyper focus if it's cut off. No matter how many minutes, no matter how many stop watches, countdowns, the whole nine, it's very trying. That's why I have these bands."
media_group,3,1,2,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,2,"My son's older through all these kids, but he's still trying to get his diploma from high school. He had a lot of issues on top of the ADD, he had some depression, and PTSD. We recently moved out to Maine. So now we're out of New York City and we're in the country. When he was in New York City and school's opened, being accepted to use the computer to hand in assignments, answer emails from teachers, that kind of thing. So he spends a lot of his time on the computer with gaming.Technology has always been his thing. One, I think it just gives him something to do. That takes his brain away from everything else that's going on in his life. But school-wise, there was in-person learning so he didn't ... The transition to in-person learning, I mean, strictly computer learning has been difficult with him because he's actually a social kid. I think so beforehand, so when the pandemic first started, he was like, ""This is awesome, because I'm an introvert and now I don't happen to see people."" [inaudible 00:25:58] really quick. Now a lot of his stuff is he communicates with school and teachers and advisers, friends. I mean, again, there's a lot of online gaming that he does and he actually even streams movies and television and stuff.It's always been hard for him to regulate that. Now that he is an adult and taller and stronger than I am, it's hard for me to kind of step in. I can't move on or just physically take it away from him.He has a job, which has helped. That's gotten him out of the house."
media_group,3,1,2,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,1,"I don't know. It's been ... I mean, because she was remote for a certain time ... I mean, it was horrible.It started well. And then it went to [inaudible 00:28:05] so much more that ... I mean, with her psychiatrists, we had to decide to use medication because it was too much. Then she was on blended learning, which ended up being remote for most of the time. Interestingly enough, the blended time was horrible when she was at home because it was asynchronous learning. So the fact that she was not engaged with a teacher and had to work independently using tools, I mean, we had to spy remotely on her computer because, I mean, it's Netflix, it's anime. We're in anime Japanese World 24/7 so much that she would even hide the laptop under her bed so that we forget about it and pull it out at night. We'd find her in the closet in the middle of the night watching anime. And she said, ""I don't remember. I must have been sleepwalking."" Those times were hard. I don't know if it's maturity. I mean, it's hard. The remote school thing, I mean, it's constantly needing to juggle between trying to get her to be independent and also have her accept that we're still her parents, and we have to be teachers at the same time. We're in that really weird role of having to do both. Overall, I mean, she's a trooper for most of the time and medication had helped with the crisis and the fact that we put a doorstopper, like one of those remotes so she can't slam the door anymore and break the wall, all of that helped. I think the combination of both. I think the crisis, the pandemic coupled with so much screen time, the need of escapism, I don't know who brought that up earlier that, all of that combined with her anxiety was a wonderful melting pot. I mean, now it's much more under control. I mean, it's not perfect, but at least she doesn't have crisis as many, at all."
media_group,3,1,2,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,6,"Okay. I have an 11-year-old boy who is in sixth grade, and I have a seven-year-old girl who is in first grade. Prior to the pandemic, I don't believe that they really use too much of the computer before for schoolwork, because they just had live classes. If they had to research something, my son, but not really, my daughter, too much. And the only time they ever really used gadgets and electronics is for pleasure or after school. But once the pandemic started, he came home with a Chromebook, and this is the end of it for us.
	My son is ADHD, he does not take any meds. But I was fully remote with them when it started and was able to sit and watch these classes go on. At first, it didn't seem like much. It seemed like it was actually working with him, to helping him kind of some of the issues he was having in physical form in school he wasn't having so I thought like, ""This is good. It's working for him."" But that was not true. Like the other woman was saying how they would submit documents or the homework, and it would be submitted and you think it's done, the thing is blank.I realized that all these assignments, I mean, it was a huge issue because he had 16 assignments that he did not do in his strongest subject, which is even worse. It was dribs and drabs of many things with half of the work. I find that they've gone through so many changes as far as technology goes. Just being on it all day and then being on it for pleasure. I don't know, for me, I find that although I am handling a kid who is just starting puberty so I know that you get a lot of other things that come with that as far as friction with rules and stuff. We've argued more than ever, ever before. It is a constant argument about like, ""It's so easy to work. All you have to do is show your face, ask a question, and submit the work."" 
	The grades are watered down. I feel like the technology has just they justify the scheduling as though when you look at it like, ""They're going to have two hours of live Zoom."" But the two hours of live Zoom is just live. It's not the 10 hours or the eight hours that they spend a day on it to do the work, to do the Zoom, to do the rest, and then everything else. It has not been good on this end. For him, especially. For my daughter, not as much of an issue. But for him, yes. 
	And just to note, they've done remote, they've done in school, which they called kind of a hybrid. But it's still remote. It's still remote in a building. It's not remote in your house, because they're doing it off the computer. It's not like they're having live actual instruction like they used to. They're still with the same overstimulation and everything else that goes along with that. I haven't found anything really positive to say about it at all"
media_group,3,1,3,what do you anticipate as people return to in person. Do you have concerns? Is there anything about the educational technology would like to see continue? Is there anything that you hope will end?,3,"Okay. Real quick. Both my kids, my son is ADHD and ASD, my daughter is ADHD and learning disabilities. But I had to make the choice because of the sentiments that everyone said, I had to make the choice to put them in Catholic school this year, because I needed him to be in-person at least five days a week. And that was a financial decision that was not taken lightly. I actually found probably one of the cheaper, less expensive Catholic schools to put them in for five days a week. And even then, there was still points where he was fully remote because maybe someone was self-professed positive test for COVID. He actually tested positive for COVID as well so he was fully remote for three weeks, several times since September, we've been remote. So it's been very difficult.
	Even in person, it's still very difficult. Because he still has people who are also remote in his classroom so that's also a big thing. That's also another distraction for him in class. So that's a different type of distraction. He's getting in-person but there's other kids who are being remote. So that's another distraction for him, which is another ball of wax. That when it's to distraction, he comes home, like today, he came home and it was obviously a very bad day for him because it was a very bad car ride for me. It was bad.Exactly. My daughter, she even goes to a charter school and they were remote three days and in-person two days. Now they are remote one day, in person four days. But she has her own paraprofessional so it's a little bit easier for her but she gets overwhelmed. Her ADHD is more of the impulsive. I think I chalk it up to her being a girl. She's not as much as emotional as he is. He's very emotional. It causes a whole different ball of wax because like I said, if he's had a bad day at school, we are all going to have a very bad day at home. "
media_group,3,1,3,what do you anticipate as people return to in person. Do you have concerns? Is there anything about the educational technology would like to see continue? Is there anything that you hope will end?,1,"The return to school, I mean, right now, she's three days one week, two days the other week. That's been really awesome and nice. She's really happy every time she comes home, much more cooperative, it's still difficult to get her out of bed. It's awesome when she's in school for all of us. She keeps saying she miss being home. The concern I have is that where I'm hoping we're going to be able to go back five days a week. But the two concerns that I have about really as more and more kids transition to going back fully in school is addressing any form of, for lack of a better word, PTSD. I did bring it up at the school as part of the SLT to what are they going to do for social and emotional well-being of the kids when they go back to school.
	The other thing that I would like to see taught in school is form of online ethics. I don't know. The fact that kids trust so much what they see and read online, and it would be great if there was a class about helping them learn about cyber security, being able to recognize on their chat rooms when there's possible grooming, phishing and all of that, and understanding that there's no privacy once you're online. It's not private, it's public. So all of that is something that, especially after seeing what ... They communicate in so many different places online and I can't control all of those chat rooms. There's [inaudible 00:47:18] publicly know that. And I think for their own safety, I think it would be great that ...My biggest concern with returning for my child is ... Like I said, I shared a little bit earlier is how he's going to be able to control his body. Again, when he was home, I'm not restricting him as far as controlling his body. But at school, they consider it as safety issue because if he's tapping or he's putting his pencil on top of ... I mean, there's plenty of chairs that my son has broken while he's been ... Folding chairs that he's broken because he's lean back on them or things like that. But that's home. School is a different story, that's a big like, ""Oh, my gosh, that's so insane."" I'm really worried about that and how that transition from being ...
	And then he also hasn't been out as much, either, because he's been so bogged down with schoolwork. So I'm worried about the overstimulation because even for myself, my youngest starting into school, so I started to drop her off to school and pick her up. Just the fact of me going out for three hours a day, I come back so tired because I feel like I'm so overwhelmed with everything that I had to pay attention to and monitor that I didn't have to do for a year. So I'm concerned of how that if it's bothering me as an adult, I can only imagine how that's going to reflect on them."
media_group,3,1,3,what do you anticipate as people return to in person. Do you have concerns? Is there anything about the educational technology would like to see continue? Is there anything that you hope will end?,4,"I would say my son's school is not going back this session. They are going to be remote throughout this session, because he goes into charter school. Doing good independently. Unlike before, when he goes to school, he is not writing any notes, he's not doing anything. I get all these phone calls, emails. He has to come back home, I have to start writing, I have to start the homework, helping with most of the homework. Type it or write it in his notebook, because some of his teachers will insist that they want the note and it has to be updated. So I have to just write the note for him. He's back, less work for me now because he works independently, he's able to do his homework on his own on his computer, turns it in at the right time. I don't have to do all this paperwork for him. But my concern is now when he goes back to school, to him, he doesn't want to go. He wants to stay remote. He prefer in remote because he's able to do his work and is able to get ...He wants to stay at home because he's able to do his work better and turns his own work faster. It doesn't have to do with all this side things like bullying, maybe harassing and the treatment from all those mates at school. He's in his pace at home, he moves around. Although he gets distracted sometimes. Just YouTube while the class is on, so he gets ... The teacher calls him, he's fumbling on his [inaudible 00:49:40] to respond and all those things.I have to go back to ... We'll be writing most of the time [inaudible 00:49:47] close to him. And when the teacher [inaudible 00:49:53] the teacher talk, put on the volume so I can hear and know when they him and just direct him and assist him. So going back to school next session is a problem that he doesn't want to think about for now. Because since the pandemic, he refused going anywhere. He doesn't trust anything. He doesn't even trust the vaccine. I told him I took the vaccine, I'm okay. He still does not because it was too fast to develop the vaccine. He's autism with ADHD, anxiety from depression, and all of those things with it.
	My concern is going back. And as Parent 1 said, internet safety, very, very important. How will the school handle this when they go back? Sometimes he goes on some sites, and he just gets up and starts screaming and running around, ""I'm scared, I'm scared."" He can't sleep, he can't do anything because of some things that he saw when he was on that site. I have a nephew in England, his age, too, 13-year. And he is all over the world with people that he doesn't know. He also has autism. There was a time he told his mother he was leaving London to go to Birmingham to meet somebody that he had been communicating with on the internet. How do they recognize the good ones from the bad? How do they recognize who they are really chatting with when they're online? This is a very big issue and a concern to me, actually."
media_group,3,1,3,what do you anticipate as people return to in person. Do you have concerns? Is there anything about the educational technology would like to see continue? Is there anything that you hope will end?,2,"My child is on the verge of leaving the nest, I suppose, maybe. He has two credits left to go with high school. He's right now in the process of deciding whether or not he wants to go to a community college or going to a trade. I'm actually looking forward for him being out of the house and coming into contact with people. Because what I've been finding with him is that he has been getting along and listening to erroneous news, fake news, basically.
	Some of this is also just being antagonistic and wanting to be. He just wants to do a reaction. He says something reactionary about everything that's going on from the pandemic itself, from vaccine, Black Matter, Asian sentiments that's been going on. It's just driving me crazy. And he needs to get out into the world instead of being locked up into this little box where he's controlling what information he's getting. That's what I want."
media_group,3,1,3,what do you anticipate as people return to in person. Do you have concerns? Is there anything about the educational technology would like to see continue? Is there anything that you hope will end?,6,"No. I was just going to say one of the things that I think really kind of concerns me is that as he's gone back into the building ... My children go to charter school as well. And they've created so much about wearing a mask, and my son, he's at home, he's not going to wear a mask in our house. So much emphasis on it. Even wearing a mask while they went to recess and his mask fell down a little bit under his nose, and they stopped him from recess and were like, ""No, you have to. Your mask were down."" I mean, some of the things are getting so kind of, for me, a little ridiculous that it's you're breathing your own CO2 all day, getting headaches, all this stuff. If the kid is going to go outside, then let him breathe the fresh air. They don't have to be next to each other. He can run alone, he doesn't need anybody running with him. He has so much energy. But it's like they're getting so ... There's so much more anxiety build up that it just doesn't help. And the thing is when you have a kid like mine, super sensitive, he's very affectionate, he doesn't like ... For him to socialize with the new kids because he went into the school last year. So he didn't even really make friends when March came around. It's like he had no roots. He was in another school for four years. So it's like how do you make friends with people if you don't get close to them? He's a very touchy feely kid. And it's like, ""Now this touchy feely kid was trying to make friends. Now has to be ..."" The expectations, especially when they know your kid has special needs and special attentions and accommodations, that they don't really look at those things fully. And everybody's on someone's scale and it shouldn't be that way. Because I feel like kids with accommodations, those needs have to be met because these kids ... I find my kid is zoning out like things don't matter. And you're talking about a kid who was honorable student. And it's how can this be affecting him in that way? That's all I wanted to say."
media_group,3,1,3,what do you anticipate as people return to in person. Do you have concerns? Is there anything about the educational technology would like to see continue? Is there anything that you hope will end?,3,"I'm sorry, I'm just going to real quick ... I apologize. I'm not going to hijack this time. I was just going to say for us parents who have our children in charter. My daughter's charter is 65% IEP so that's a little different. But other charter schools, that's the thing about charters, that's the gamble. They kind of comply with the IEPs, they kind of don't but that's the thing about charters. We got to take it, we don't have to take it. Just depends on the charter. It's such a hard thing. And I know a lot of folks have just mentioned about keeping track of your kid online. 
	I put Bark on child's my laptop. It's B-A-R-K, it's an app that you download. You have to pay for it but at least it tells you if someone's fishing them. If someone's saying the key words and stuff like, that they send an alert to you. So that's B-A-R-K. I put Bark on my kid's laptop so I can get the alerts. At least, that would be like, ""Okay, let me figure this out."" But it is an awful ... It's such a hard time that we're all going through. Even I as an adult, one of my emails got like I got an alert, alert. It's on the dark web. I'm like, ""I don't even know what the hell the dark web is."" 
	We're exposing to our kids all of these things. And if your child has ADHD or ASD or ADHD with other comorbidities, it's even more difficult. Because it's like it's so hard to protect them. You want to protect them, you want to do what's best. But at this point in time, you don't even know what's best for your child. Because you know the COVID rate amongst kids is less than 1%. Going back to what she was saying about if your child is a social little person, then what are you going to tell them? Like, ""You can't be that social. You got to stay arms away."" But that's so difficult for a kid to comprehend that.
	I's very distressing. I'm not going to cry. But it's such a very distressing time that this is a distressing time for us as adults. It's an even more distressing time for our children. I know one mom just mentioned about the kid not being able to sit still. If that's the case, on your kid's IEP, you can get a sensory cushion and have that with your kid just so they can help. My son, for the longest time, I had him to have a sensory cushion. He was getting in trouble. He was sneaking ... In elementary school, he's in junior high school now, but he was sneaking into the classrooms, into the closets to inhale marker. That's not good. Like, ""Oh, no,"" right, exactly. He inhale marker. Well, that is a sign of anxiety. And I said to them, I'm like, ""When are you planning on telling me this? After he's graduated from smelling markers to something else? When are you planning on saying, 'Hey, your kid has anxiety?'"""
media_group,3,1,4,"any concerns you had about social media prior to the pandemic, how that changed, benefits, concerns, just hearing both asides",5,"I will go first because I have to get off. What social media is starting to ... I mean, he still hasn't really gotten on to it. The kid versions where he's able to connect with his cousins. I've also found that his relationships with school have not been the greatest because he hasn't been able to see them in person. But because he's able to see his cousin, those relationships have grown more. I'm not sure what the correlation is. It's been there. But that's who he's been in this space with. And very early on and a lot of you were talking about some of the challenges with navigating the world wide web with the children.
	One of the things that we did, there was a, I forget, I was trying to see if I could find it, but it was a video that kind of talks about kidnappings and things like that that were kind of happening. It was an actual show, and we sat down and we watched it. We had a long conversation afterwards. Like, ""This is why I don't want you having conversations about where you live or letting even ..."" Because he has a younger brother, I'm like, ""Even being able to communicate."" I said, ""Sometimes your brother might say something to give indicators about the community that we live in, that might lead them that much closer to the house."" So just helping them to be more aware of and be mindful of their surroundings and how the information might be perceived on the other side has been a big point for my husband and I and what we've been trying to relay to him. Because we want to have him to be more autonomous.
	I think somebody was sharing the site, I put on a blocker on the phone and on the computer as well so then I'm getting alerts where he's going to YouTube and some of these things. Because even videos that are coming up that are way too inappropriate, in my opinion, where they're showing crosses, devils, and all kinds of things. That's not something that I want my 12-year-old to be engaging and experiencing at this time. So the social media platform, I feel like has definitely expanded and is now more so like in the TikTok era, in the YouTube era. I know YouTube has been trying to do a lot to try to curb it but it's still not great. So those are just some of the things that I know that I've been doing to kind of manage it."
media_group,3,1,4,"any concerns you had about social media prior to the pandemic, how that changed, benefits, concerns, just hearing both asides",3,"I just wanted to jump in real quick. So sorry about outside. But in addition to social media use, I know that some kids aren't on social media yet. So even if it's just the YouTube or like watching movies or videos, any sorts of media that your child has been engaged in over the past year, definitely tell us about it. And once again, I'm very sorry about outside."
media_group,3,1,4,"any concerns you had about social media prior to the pandemic, how that changed, benefits, concerns, just hearing both asides",1,"So social media, interestingly enough, I think it's been in a weird way better. I don't know if it's because she's maturing. Also, girls start social media, I think, earlier than boys in general. We had talks, we had contracts beforehand. There's no selfies allowed on Instagram. It's a way of showcasing art, it's not about looking how many likes. And it turns out that they don't really use Instagram the way that they were mostly about posting stories. So they're more in the Snapchat, in and out world of showcasing what they like.
	I think it's been really fun, because I can see what she's interested in it in things. And they've been really good conversation starters. Also, it's a great way of monitoring her growth and seeing who she's chatting with. It's been kind of interesting. The only thing that worries me in the social media world is all those. Because I discovered Discord, and then there's chat rooms and games. But there's also, what is that? There's that one game that everyone plays and all the adults love too. I forgot what it's called.Yes. It's been great. Strategy and fun. The only area that I worry the most is YouTube, I must admit, because that's the area where she feels very comfortable commenting on a lot of things, and not realizing that she still comments like a little girl, with mistakes and all that. So that's my only concern, but overall, I find, interestingly enough, a positive experience."
media_group,3,1,4,"any concerns you had about social media prior to the pandemic, how that changed, benefits, concerns, just hearing both asides",6,"I don't think my experience has been pretty good. I think for my little one ... My son is always on animes and looking at gamers showing videos of games and listening to commentary. I think he watches a lot of puppet show. Things I find very silly and immature. I'm like, ""Okay, not a big deal."" But my little one, she likes to watch all these toy openings and kids talking about things that they're opening and she wants a YouTube channel. But I have found that I had to put some blocks on there because I had a lot of completely sexualized, inappropriate things pop up that I was mortified that she was on it and it was ... 
	And her brother noticed it. And I'm like, ""What is that?"" She was on just some kind of kitten. It just popped up. And she, of course, you see something you never seen before. You're going to be like ... And it was so instinctual. She was trying to hide. And I was like, ""How can this just come up out of nowhere?"" There was like nothing that she was on before. I feel like the bad guy because I had to completely stop it. Like, ""No, you can't get on it."" And she said, ""But I just want to see the video of the games and the kids. I want to have my own channel.""
	And I'm just like, ""This kind of stuff. I can't have porn going in front of my seven-year-old. This is highly problematic."" I find that even when you do it and you do the YouTube for kids, it's not even that safe either because there's some anime styles that are just, for my taste, a little too much at this point in time. I feel like they haven't been able to have so much happening. We couldn't go on vacation because of COVID and everything. When it first happened, we had to cancel. I feel like they've lost so much that the one thing they have is the internet. And it's now I have to be the bad guy and say, ""No, you can't be on this."" It's frustrating to say the least."
media_group,3,1,4,"any concerns you had about social media prior to the pandemic, how that changed, benefits, concerns, just hearing both asides",2,"Sorry. I'll be quick. One of the things that I find is that these kids, their attention spans ... I mean, first of all, the [inaudible 01:11:25] kind of problem with their attention span. And with the internet and everything that's on it moves at the speed of light and so quickly. They're getting information that is stunted in a lot of ways. So they're not even getting full pictures. But my son gets a lot of his news from memes. And they'll come to me and be like, ""Mom, this and so and so."" I'm like, ""Are you freaking kidding me, dude? Why don't you watch PBS News Hour with me and get the full picture? And then you can make up your mind and have ..."" It's just ridiculous. Anyway, that's my piece."
media_group,3,1,4,"any concerns you had about social media prior to the pandemic, how that changed, benefits, concerns, just hearing both asides",4,"Let me see. Mine go on these, YouTube videos, watch them. And then Discord, he does Discord so much now. He organizes his own, whatever you call the [inaudible 01:12:19], and when he says something that is obsessing, he comes back and start complaining about it. In the bathroom, you will hear him ranting and complaining and whining and everything continuously. Then I have to stress, ""You know what? You have to stop it. I'm going to take you all. I'm going to take the computer, I'm going to take everything."" ""I'll stop. I'll stop it."" Goes back in that circle and all of those things. I don't know how to stop him. I really want to but I don't know how to stop him. But his cousin is engaged, he connect with other people. And this is it.Because of pandemic. He came too engrossed in that [inaudible 01:13:19] before the pandemic."
media_group,3,1,5,how did your child's use of technology for school purposes changed during the pandemic? Was it beneficial? Did you have concerns or find it problematic? ,1,"I don't know. It's been ... I mean, because she was remote for a certain time ... I mean, it was horrible.It started well. And then it went to [inaudible 00:28:05] so much more that ... I mean, with her psychiatrists, we had to decide to use medication because it was too much. Then she was on blended learning, which ended up being remote for most of the time. Interestingly enough, the blended time was horrible when she was at home because it was asynchronous learning. So the fact that she was not engaged with a teacher and had to work independently using tools, I mean, we had to spy remotely on her computer because, I mean, it's Netflix, it's anime. We're in anime Japanese World 24/7 so much that she would even hide the laptop under her bed so that we forget about it and pull it out at night. We'd find her in the closet in the middle of the night watching anime. 
	And she said, ""I don't remember. I must have been sleepwalking."" Those times were hard. I don't know if it's maturity. I mean, it's hard. The remote school thing, I mean, it's constantly needing to juggle between trying to get her to be independent and also have her accept that we're still her parents, and we have to be teachers at the same time. We're in that really weird role of having to do both. Overall, I mean, she's a trooper for most of the time and medication had helped with the crisis and the fact that we put a doorstopper, like one of those remotes so she can't slam the door anymore and break the wall, all of that helped.I think the combination of both. I think the crisis, the pandemic coupled with so much screen time, the need of escapism, I don't know who brought that up earlier that, all of that combined with her anxiety was a wonderful melting pot. I mean, now it's much more under control. I mean, it's not perfect, but at least she doesn't have crisis as many, at all."
media_group,3,1,5,how did your child's use of technology for school purposes changed during the pandemic? Was it beneficial? Did you have concerns or find it problematic? ,5,"When the pandemic started, they went completely virtual. And they tried, they did, they kept the same schedule as when they were in school, as far as hours were concerned. So his day starts at eight o'clock in the morning and goes until 3:45 in the afternoon. So typically, he'll go until 4:30. So he was pretty much in that space. They were doing 90-minute blocks. So they broke it down to do 35-minute blocks with a break before they went into the next. His level of focus, I guess it was good, because with his ADHD, he was able to make noise and kind of be in his face, and he was on mute so nobody really heard him. He's [crosstalk 00:32:33] stuff and doing things that keep his mind engaged.
	In school, it presents a problem where he would yell out a lot during his class sessions. I'm just envisioning, I'm like, ""Oh, my gosh. This is what you do in class and why the teachers are always having a fit and calling me and feeling like, 'What can we do to get him more focused?'"" He hasn't been taking his medicine during the pandemic. We've had some times where it's almost like a threat, like, ""If you don't focus, I'm going to make you take your medicine,"" kind of thing. Because the issue in class was he'll be in class all day but he wasn't doing any work. So his teachers would call me or they would text me, and there were like, ""He turned in work but it's all blank."" In addition to him having to do his night homework, he also now has to do all of the work that he didn't do for class during the day.
	He's pretty much on his computer from when he wakes up in the morning at 7:00 until going to bed at night at 9:00 trying to ... With breaks to kind of go to the bathroom and eat. It's a lot. It's overwhelming. A lot of times, just like Parent 1 was just saying, we had to do some stop gaps, too. We got the blink camera to put in the room so that I'm able to see or listen or hear. If he's listening or watching a video game or watching YouTube instead of participating in classes, I'm like, ""It has to be something more than you telling me that you're in class and you're not doing the work."" I had him sit in a room and it's difficult because I'm working and it's like, ""Okay, I'm trying to oversee,"" And like I said, I have three kids so I'm trying to [inaudible 00:34:33] all of them in virtual learning. And trying to keep them all up to par in what they're doing. I definitely felt that it was challenging.
	But the good parts about it were that he was able to connect with friends and family members that he wouldn't on a regular basis. On the weekends, if he did well in school, I'm like, ""Okay, then you can spend time with your family."" But that just meant more time on the screen. Maybe on a different type of device. Now, it's the TV instead of the computer. Or maybe it's his, what do you call it? His phone or other electronic devices. But it's still, to me, overkill. And I feel like when he goes back to school, I think it's just going to be much harder, because I don't know what the [inaudible 00:35:27] kind of does that look like. With overstimulation and then they go from overstimulation to something not so [crosstalk 00:35:35]"
media_group,3,2,1,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,6,"So before the pandemic I feel like, especially with technology, my kids didn't really have much at all that they had to do. My oldest is in sixth grade now, so I think that might have changed going to middle school, however, while they were in elementary school, they really didn't have any assignments that they needed technology for, for the most part. So it was rare. And then, of course, last March school went completely virtual and everything was online. So it was like a night and day change for us. It was a disaster, to be honest. Well, really, they're on all day. They're on all day. Now, one of my children is a really unique learner and one of them did okay. One of them was able to go on. But then one of them is really ... He's unique and his teacher not seeing him in person, it affected him. Even this year, for example, he started fully virtual at the beginning of the school year and his teacher, since she hadn't met him and she hadn't seen him in person, she didn't grasp that if he wasn't doing an assignment, it wasn't because ... He has ADHD and if he wasn't doing the assignment, it wasn't that he was trying not to do it, he was just having a hard time and she wasn't there to be able to intercept and to sit with him and to see how she could help him. She wasn't able to help him because she didn't know what the problem was because he wasn't there. Yeah. Now he's back full time and he is doing a lot better. Still, I feel like they're just online all day long and it's a problem. "
media_group,3,2,1,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,1,"I might echo Parent 6 because, similarly, my son too, prior to the pandemic the most time he would spend on any electronic device was either in school for a computer media class and then after school or after homework, he'll have some free time, we call it free time, where he can play on his iPad or his cellphone for a couple of hours before bed. But, I mean, it was a total 180 where now he's fully remote. And actually, it was like a double whammy because I was actually diagnosed with breast cancer in February, so having this diagnosis and having the pandemic and then all of this pressure on my son to make sure that I'm healthy, make sure that he's doing well in school, it did take a negative toll at first. 
	But, again, through reading affirmative things and helping him along and making sure that he sees me in a not just a healthy state but also in a physically healthy situation, it helped him. But literally, his electronic usage went from pretty much nonexistent to almost 200%, because after school he goes directly to his iPad to play. When that dies, he goes directly to his iPhone and then if that dies, then he'll go to my computer to do classwork. It was like a never ending cycle and I have to break him off of it. I would try to have not just physical exercise but mental exercise as well when he's on break and when I also work remotely, fully remote, we would for lunch just go outside, take a walk, just talk about the sky or talk about the birds chirping. Something that we don't have to focus on where it's a problem or it's worrisome. That seemed to help for the time being. But I think when we come back indoors, it's back to the gadgets. 
	I would say his learning, his academics actually improved. He has an IEP. He has-Right. I mean, as much as he's on these devices, he actually improved academically because it enhanced some of his skills that he already had, his computer skills and navigating. He was able to work independently and actually become a leader in his class where he's in the chatroom trying to troubleshoot those who are even having technical difficulties logging on. It'd be so funny. But-Right. Well, can you help mommy record this Zoom? But I've seen and his teachers have also seen a very much more confident student and person overall. Not to take up too much time, but my son, he had confidence issues and wanting to be liked by everyone, wanting to be friends with everyone. But this past year especially, he really stepped up to the plate and actually became the leader confidently and was able to excel. So I'm very proud of him. I'm very proud of him. And I'm cancer free too. "
media_group,3,2,1,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,4,"Okay, great. So it has had a negative impact on my household because it's too much computer time. And I remember those questions when I was filling out one of those questionnaires when I brought my daughter there to be evaluated. It was speaking about the problems in reference to the computers. I'm like, ""I don't have those kind of problems. What are they talking about?"" Now fast forward to this pandemic, now I understand. I'm having those problems. I'm having problems because now she wants to be on the computer all the time and it's hard for me to take it away because she has to do her schoolwork and she's learning remotely. 
	It's hard to sanction that because she'll say, ""Oh, I need to do my homework, or I need this app or that app."" It's just difficult to sanction the time so I have to let her use her computer but I catch her and she's getting in trouble with the computer because now all of these open sites and bringing up conversations that I never thought I would have to have with my 11-year-old daughter because she's on all of these different sites. And here, I'm putting in all these parental controls but she's very savvy so she can overstep those controls and now her and her friend and then teaching her how not to turn over your screen to your friend, I know you think is your friend, but there's so many things that you can get into problems with. 
	So for me, I'm just devastated by all of this computer time. And I have two children, so even the little one ... I mean, they need some in person. They need to not always have to rely on the computer. And that was my problem even before the pandemic because I saw the teachers were moving into having your children learn more with these apps. And sometimes I have to tell them it's okay for them to use pencil and paper because I feel you learn better, at least until you have the concept, then you can do it on the computer. Yeah. I'm not impressed with all of this, everything on the computer. For me, it's just a negative impact. "
media_group,3,2,1,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,3,"Yeah. So before the pandemic, my oldest daughter who was then in eighth grade, she was the primary computer user in terms of schoolwork. But even then, she still had other things that she could use. She had texts that they would send home. She had articles that were printed out already or worksheets or things like that. She has some trouble with writing. She had OT to help her with writing for, I think it's dysgraphia. And it's much, much better now. So the computer, she tended to use it a bit for anything that involved writing and she did a lot of voice to text and things like that anyway, but she did have a lot of alternatives. 
	My middle daughter who is about to turn 11, she hardly used the computer at all. She used it sometimes for some research things if she was working on a project. But most of her work was either done in school or it was done on paper. It was read a book and write a paragraph or something like that. She was then in fourth grade. Then, of course, this hit and they were 100% learning online. 
	It was more successful for my fourth grader because her teacher had it organized. She would give them a checklist on Google Classroom so they could see what they needed to do each day. She would give them a preparation for what was coming up, like, ""Here's what the week will look like."" And she also had live class sessions and she had it broken into ... She did three meetings per day, and one was a morning meeting to talk about the plan for the day, then she would give them an assignment, then she would have them meet back again an hour later to check in about the assignment and do the next thing. And then in the afternoon she did some small group work. 
	Where it was really challenging is that my daughter is in a French dual language program and so, of course, and we're anglophone, so that just dropped. I mean, that's one reason why her teacher tried to do a lot of small group work to try to help build that up, but that was certainly a challenge for us. We had to try to find ways to help her be exposed to the language so she wouldn't lose her ability then for starting fifth grade and then struggling. 
	But my eighth grader, some of her teachers were amazing with checking in and having office hours and doing some instruction and tutoring and things like that online and some of them, it was like they just were phoning it in at the end of the semester and she was teaching herself. And that was very difficult. This year, it's changed because now she's in high school and she's at a performing arts school. It's been a real challenge because her art is violin and it's really hard to do instrumental work with groups Zoom. They've done their violin lessons on Zoom but it was just one on one. But her orchestra class, they really haven't done any orchestra all year because you can't really do an orchestra on Zoom. There's a lag between the things. So that's been a little bit of a challenge. 
	But she's had all live classes online this year, because their school, that's how they set it up. That has been fantastic. Because it's enabled two things to happen. One is that because she does have ADHD and she has a really hard time organizing herself, she doesn't really have to organize herself because she's in the lessons all day. And then she has a little bit of homework to do, but it's not an extreme amount. And they do a lot of breakout rooms and stuff so she's able to do some small group work and it helps her, I think, because she doesn't have to be teaching herself. 
	It also helps because when I'm home, I'm hearing what she's learning in class. That's been really great. With all my kids, hearing their teachers teaching them online, I've been blown away by the skill of these teachers. They're amazing. And the thoughtfulness that they put into their projects and developing their curriculum, it's just outstanding and I feel like that's been a great gift to have that insight. And it's also helped me when it comes time for me to help them, because I can say, ""Oh, no. Remember, Mme Simone was saying that you needed to do this with this project. Yeah. I understand you forgot that, but I heard her say it so let's do that."" So that's been helpful. It's been good. Yeah. The challenge that we've had with mostly my middle daughter is that she also has anxiety and OCD and so she, first of all, can go down a rabbit hole when she's just learning online. Secondly, this year she's been doing blended learning so when she's in school, she's doing all right. When she's at home, she gets almost no work done. I mean, she's been working today and as of the time I came in here, I think she had done one math problem. She just has a really hard time. And I have to see her screen at all times. If I can't see her screen, she's not doing what she's supposed to do and that's [crosstalk 00:38:49]-And that makes problems because then I have a five-year-old, and if I have to look at the screen all day of her older sister, I can't be doing things with the five-year-old. And my five-year-old then spends a lot of time coloring or playing with magnet tiles or watching videos because I have to keep saying, ""I'm sorry it's a beautiful day. We can't go outside. I have to make sure your sister's doing her work."" We've had to do that too. We have to lock them in a room. Would it be all right if I just add something to what you ...Okay. So there were two things that Parent 5 said that reminded me of stuff with my kids. One of them was that the addiction to the screen time is followed by this ... In the beginning of the pandemic at least, we really had to force them to go outside. One of my kids just had a meltdown yesterday because we had to go to in person violin lesson because her teacher resumed that. She says, ""I don't want to go outside. I don't want to go outside."" So definitely there's been an element of ... Once they're out, it's okay but it's like leaving the apartment has become a bigger deal. And one of my kids, she had almost lost complete contact with friends until she consciously ... We both, we planned it out. You've got to start contacting your friends because it just slipped away. 
	The other thing I wanted to say, which Parent 5 was talking about her son's skills with the technology and it's not just the Zoom or the Google Classroom or Google Meet, but my kids have used so many more different types of programs like Flip Grid. They're creating presentations with Google Slides. They're using special effects in their presentations. They're creating videos. The one with the violin, she's working with something called Click Track so that she can coordinate her timing with the timing of someone else's playing so that they can line up their performance videos. They're doing animations for projects. That's been amazing to see that, because they've then been able to use what appeals to them and what works with their skillset and their abilities to do their assignments, because there's a lot of variability in how they present the information and then they've got this array of options through technology to work with and that's been a real gift as well. So it's definitely been a double edged issue. "
media_group,3,2,1,how did your child use technology before the pandemic for educational purposes? ,5,"Yeah. Well, prior to the pandemic my kids were very exposed to technology. They were using it as well for school. They had a lot of apps for reading. My older son, Andrew, he has a-It was. It was because it was controlled. Whenever I needed to, I was able to put away the devices. But after the pandemic, like another mommy said, I have a problem taking the laptop away because he uses it for school. Now, the negative of it is my older son who has an IEP is becoming more addicted to the screen. If it's not the laptop, it's the iPad, when the iPad goes empty, it goes to my phone. He's just switching from one device to the other. But as far as school goes, he is doing amazing, a lot better than when he was in school. Remote has done wonders for us. He's more focused. He's totally in charge of his school day. I don't get involved. He gets great grades. And it helped us also with the transition. 
	I was very nervous about Andrew going into sixth grade. It's a new school, new teachers, new system. But that worked out so well for us because now he got to know all his teachers and he's doing great academically. He's doing amazingly. So that was very good. It's just that he's becoming more addicted and less socially involved and that's the part I'm not happy with. Yeah. Lucky for us, honest to God, I pray for these teachers. They're amazing. I don't know if it's us, we jut are lucky with the teachers he has. They're very dedicated. He has live classes. I don't feel like he's missing anything. And I also get to see how Andrew is like with his teachers and his classmates. And he takes charge also, like another mommy said. It was funny, I was laughing because he does the same thing. He gives everybody advice on technology. He's like the tech person in the class. Even his teachers, they tell me if Andrew's not there, we get nervous. He's enjoying it. I'm happy to see how he's like and he's doing great. And I feel like when this is all over, when school is over, I can go back to controlling device time, screen time. He's not going to give it up willingly. I'll have to hide devices like I used to before, which is fine. It used to work. So it's good. "
media_group,3,2,2,"some people have gone back in person or you're anticipating going back in person, what are the challenges that you anticipate and are there parts of this that you hope will continue and are there parts of this way of educating kids that you hope will end? ",2,"I'll go. I guess I'm anticipating ... I would like him to go back to school. He's in ninth grade right now. So hopefully he'll be able to go back in person. He does have asthma so that's what I'm really concerned about, just him being in person. But I like the aspect that they can utilize their computers in the classroom. That's a good benefit. But I do like the teachers teaching live. That's another thing. But he needs that social skills. That interaction is what really ... It's just me and him in the house and I think we're both getting tired of each other talking to each other. He needs that input with other people, other teenagers his own age. 
	And I like that the teachers are incorporating all this new technology. He's learned how to type and just things he should have known how to do, and even learned life skills within the house, which is great. Just so we could incorporate all those things when they go back into the classroom. Yeah. If I could just briefly piggyback off of what everyone had shared is my son has been fully remote and I think with him graduating fifth grade, entering a new school sixth grade. That's already some pressure right there and whether or not he'll be in blended learning or in in-person learning full time, that's really dependent on the current environment around September. My son as well has asthma so, of course, that's always his health. His safety is always at the forefront. And my son, again, I had JD as an IEP so he's very hands on, visual type of student who requires that physical in person learning. It's not to say that he can do without, but in a physical classroom setting I feel that now that he's matured and has a little more confidence, he can enhance those skills better in in-person learning. 
	Again, I'm with Parent 5. We all have enjoyed being ... I'm a social butterfly, but I really am recluse as well. And I passed that along to my son. We've been home together during this time, however, it's going to be a change for the both of us. Myself, I'm being called back into work as well. So getting into a new normal, of course, it's going to take some adjusting to, but I'm sure that we can overcome any challenges that we face, especially if we are not only physically prepared but mentally prepared for it as well. "
media_group,3,2,2,"some people have gone back in person or you're anticipating going back in person, what are the challenges that you anticipate and are there parts of this that you hope will continue and are there parts of this way of educating kids that you hope will end? ",4,"Yeah. I will be very excited when they go back in person. The part that the teachers are doing a fantastic job and I have to say they are going above and beyond during this remote learning. And I know one thing they said, ""Oh, my kid is so great. She's so great. She's doing so well. She's leading the class."" Yeah. She is doing a lot of that stuff because she's home with me every day and the teachers don't really have to deal so much with those behavioral issues because now all the behavioral issues are home with me so she can shine with them for the most part. But for my youngest one, she loves that in person and she needs that. For me, I'm working every day from home so to work every day from home and try to teach a third grader and a sixth grader, it's very difficult. So I definitely would love for them to be back in school and in person learning and they can use some of this technology and hopefully the teachers will continue to be as great as they've always been. "
media_group,3,2,2,"some people have gone back in person or you're anticipating going back in person, what are the challenges that you anticipate and are there parts of this that you hope will continue and are there parts of this way of educating kids that you hope will end? ",1,"Hi. I'm looking forward to ... My daughter's about to start five days. She's been going three days, she's been going two or three days, my five and 11-year-old. It's been so exhausting. Well, it's enabled me to see where the problems and challenges are. I've asked for an IEP review because I'm like, ""These are some other issues that I didn't realize were going on."" It's been so exhausting and I haven't been able to do any of my work. As I think Parent 4 eluded to or said, it's a struggle to do anything you have to do when you've got these kids that you have to teach as well. So I'm looking forward to them being able to go into the classroom and do and have their learning more focused there. 
	And for my five-year-old, it's so important because of the social stuff and for my 15-year-old, she's just going to be starting back three days. And she's done really well with being fairly connected to people given that she's never stepped foot in her school. She's in ninth grade. But it's going to be great for her to be able to be there and really to connect with her teachers and with her classmates. What I'm worried about is that ... Well, two things. One, is it gets harder for the older one who needs a little bit more ... Who's not as self directed and so she's then more independent, which actually makes it a challenge for me to keep track of what's going on. 
	But my 11-year-old has so much anxiety, she gets so many physical symptoms of that, that she's had a lot of school refusal in the past. And having it be just two or three days was what kept us going this year, was you can go, you can have that time, but guess what? When she was refusing on a Wednesday, ""I'm not going to school. I feel sick. My stomach hurts. My head hurts."" We would say, ""But it's the last day of the week. Then tomorrow and Friday you're home."" So that was what kept us going. I'm not looking forward to those morning challenges again because I feel like it's going to be a lot for her because she's just so anxious. "
media_group,3,2,2,"some people have gone back in person or you're anticipating going back in person, what are the challenges that you anticipate and are there parts of this that you hope will continue and are there parts of this way of educating kids that you hope will end? ",5,"Well, my kids are not too excited about going back to school and that worries me. Neither am I. I've gotten really very selfish. I enjoy having them home. I love having them home. And the only thing we miss really is the social aspect of being physically in school and the after school programs. I had them registered in chess, soccer, all these activities. But having them home has been awesome. So I think it's going to be difficult for all of us when they start going back to school. "
media_group,3,2,2,"some people have gone back in person or you're anticipating going back in person, what are the challenges that you anticipate and are there parts of this that you hope will continue and are there parts of this way of educating kids that you hope will end? ",6,"I just want to add my kids have been full time for a while. My husband and I are both essential workers so we've had no choice other than we had to keep him out of school. They're really happy back in school full time now. My oldest is now in middle school so he had to wake up early. So he had to get on the bus-He had to leave at 7:00, so that's really his only complaint. Other than that, he said that he's really, really happy to be back in school. They're really enjoying being with the other kids. "
media_group,3,2,3,"what was the social media and media used, and by media we mean YouTube or any kind of media that they're consuming. What was the use like before the pandemic, how has that changed? Any concerns, any benefits that you're seeing from changes in social media use? ",6,"So what's changed with the social media, so my kids, as I'm sure all the rest of the year kids do also, they really like Roblox and they want to play with their friends. So before it was more controlling, okay, you have this amount of time to go on YouTube, you have this amount of time to play. But now, when everybody was home, the Roblox playing with friends and talking on the phone at the same time was the only socialization that they had. That was their only option. So it got a little more and a little more and then they said, ""Oh, well, I'm playing with my friends so can I keep playing?"" So then that time extended a little bit. So it's hard when that is the only way that they could socialize or when they're on FaceTime, when they're going on FaceTime with friends. When that's the only way that they could socialize, that has been really difficult to reign it in and stop them from it. So we've been having a lot of challenges with that. 
	And then the YouTube videos start and that's when everything they have, like their school issued iPads, and so I could take away their own personal devices, but the school iPads have YouTube on them. So I can't ... It's for school so I can't just take it away. So then-they end up sneaking. Mm-hmm (affirmative). It's a lot harder. And sometimes I don't even want to because that's the way that they're able to socialize. They're starting to go to the park with kids and doing more now but it's been a challenge this whole time. "
media_group,3,2,3,"what was the social media and media used, and by media we mean YouTube or any kind of media that they're consuming. What was the use like before the pandemic, how has that changed? Any concerns, any benefits that you're seeing from changes in social media use? ",3,"So I've had a very similar experience. My then eighth grader was already on social media because I reluctantly let her have an Instagram account because her class at school, her cohort, had a cohort Instagram chat going and they mostly used it for things like, ""Hey, I have a doctor's appointment today. Can anyone tell me what I'm going to miss in this class?"" For that type of thing. So they mostly used it well. There were some incidents though of kids sharing porn and things like that on it. That was obviously a problem. But this year, yeah, she's used it really ... That, and the other thing was SnapChat that I was like, ""You cannot have SnapChat. Absolutely not. It's like a sexual predator's playground."" 
	And then she had a friend, a pen pal in New Zealand, who she found out was on SnapChat. So then it was like, ""All right."" Kind of like Parent 6 was saying, that's how they connect. I mean, yes, they can write letters but it's so much more immediate and they socialize so much more so I was like, ""Fine, okay. You can use SnapChat."" So it was creeping up. But I think I have to have my rules. I have to have the passwords. I have to have access because I want to make sure that they're safe online. And so I periodically go in and check. 
	My 11-year-old doesn't have any of these accounts. What she has is YouTube and she's become obsessed with various YouTubers and it's prompted some discussions about what we value and what we don't. She definitely sneaks it when she's not supposed to. That's definitely been a challenge. And again, same thing, school computer, you can't exactly ... I mean, she does have to do work. It's been great in some respects because she's been able to use it for school, but also I don't really want you looking at these people and following what they're doing because I don't agree with it. 
	So, yeah. That's been a little bit of an issue. I've worried a lot about body image and things like that with them because I feel like when they're following these people on whether Instagram or YouTube or wherever else, a lot of these people are making tons of money as so called influencers and they have a very different lifestyle. And I feel like sometimes that's hard for them to see. But one of my kids went through a little bit of an issue around food and she was talking about like she wished she could be anorexic because she wanted to be a certain way and we had to have a whole discussion with the psychiatrist around that and talking about positive body image and stuff. And I think she seems like she's on a better path. 
	But I wanted to say one last thing about it, is that where it has been really good is that my oldest daughter, during this time, she seems to be like a lot of adolescent girls are, I'm reading, she's developed vocal and motor ticks, which is one thing I'm worried about when she goes back to school. At home she can hide it from people to some degree but when she's in person, it's a lot harder. But she's actually connected a lot with people on Instagram who also have some of these struggles and she's starting to talk about herself more as neurodivergent as opposed to having a disorder and things like that, and learning techniques for managing it. She'll say, ""Oh, I found out that so and so on Instagram has the same kind of ticks that I do and this is what she does to help herself. That's been fantastic, that it's really enabled her to develop a sense of agency around herself and her managing [crosstalk 01:01:17].Yeah, yeah. So that's been the positive, whereas the rest is like a minefield. "
media_group,3,2,3,"what was the social media and media used, and by media we mean YouTube or any kind of media that they're consuming. What was the use like before the pandemic, how has that changed? Any concerns, any benefits that you're seeing from changes in social media use? ",4,"I have to say that my kids, even the eight-year-old, everyone wants to be a YouTuber. They want to be a YouTube star or they want to be famous or Instagram famous and that's killing me right now. Because with everything that's going on, you're like, ""What happened to I wanted to be a doctor or lawyer or teacher?"" Everyone want to be a YouTuber and even the eight-year-old. I'll go, ""What do you want to do on YouTube?"" And she's struggling with, ""Maybe I can open toys."" I'm just so over it. I just feel like I have to get back to basics. And it's harder with the 12-year-old because she's exposed to so much and she's faster than I am with these computer skills. So if I see something I don't like, she can hit two or three buttons and it's done. So I spend the rest of my time going, ""Go back to that page. Go back to that page. I know I saw it."" 
	I just feel like this whole social media, these influencer ... And I didn't even know what an influencer was before the pandemic. I had to learn all of this during the pandemic. And when they see these kids in these beautiful houses and their parents. The YouTubers where the twin girls or whoever, all I can do is watch it and say, ""Hey, their house is clean. You see they cleaned their room. Are you cleaning your room? They make their beds every day. Yes."" So these people are making tons and tons of money and they have all of these toys and these beautiful houses. Like one young lady said, the body imaging. I'm watching my 12-year-old constantly looking at her body and excited about it or say, ""Hey, I want my boobs bigger or maybe my butt should be bigger."" I'm so over it. 
	So even when this pandemic is over and these kids are back in school, this whole social media presence is here to stay. And I have to now navigate it so that I know what my kids are doing. And that whole SnapChat, I had to shut SnapChat down so quick because it's just too much. And the schools don't have SnapChat on their computers so I can say, ""Hey, no. We're not having it."" But the social media presence, I just have to stay on top of it. And with all that I have to do, I really don't want to be on social media like that but I have to. "

",5,"I actually thank you for this meeting because I thought I was the only one in this world that's having a problem with YouTubers. My son has developed such an addiction to video game YouTubers and I freak out. I just flip. The more I tell him not to be on them, the more addicted he gets. Like I said, after school I'm hiding all devices. Hopefully it'll be under control. "
media_group,3,3,1,the ways technology has been useful during the pandemic and some of the ways it has been problematic during the pandemic.,4,"I can go first. I think I had similar challenges to yours. I think I had similar challenges to yours but I said it helps us stay connected. Even though we're going through this pandemic, we were able to stay connected with our friends, our families. We can continue to do our work, whether it be schoolwork or our own adult work and just helped us be more creative about it.And for myself, my kids are pretty tech savvy, but for me, I feel like I wasn't. And I think this gave me an opportunity to really kind of expand on my small tech skills, so those were my three pros.And then, the cons were, yes, the endless playing of games. I'm just constantly finding myself, asking them to please try doing other things, read a book, take a break, something. But if I let them, there'll be on video games all day and it's been difficult to monitor also because, even though we have like a policy that everybody has to give up their devices at a certain time, they still found ways around it, you know? And the other thing is that I just find myself, it's just a point of contention now. We're just negotiating, constantly renegotiating and negotiating those things. Those were my cons."
media_group,3,3,1,the ways technology has been useful during the pandemic and some of the ways it has been problematic during the pandemic.,3,"I can share. We have Similar issues. I have an 11 year old and a 16 year old. I would say, the overwhelming negative for everybody in the house is just way, way, way too much screen time and just really hard to... and I've never been good at managing the screen time. The only way I was ever able to do it was to just say like, ""No screen time during the week on a school night and screen time as much as you want on the weekends.""Now, because they need screens to do their homework, like trying to keep them from not, if you walk out of the room and you walk back in and like, they're playing my Minecraft or if not, it's on a hidden screen or whatever. You're like, oh, so my coping mechanism, of just saying all or nothing is kind of taken away now. Yeah, way too much screen time for everybody, me included.I'd say the biggest plus has been so many artists have found new ways of getting their art out to people, whether that's book illustrators or musical concerts. There's one band we would love to see become, maybe once a year, once every two years. And he's been doing a weekly concert every Saturday. That's a really nice thing that normally an artist we would only get to see once a year, we get to see every Saturday. And artists like Oliver Jeffers or Mo Willems or things like that, you know, doing really fun art related things has been fun."
media_group,3,3,1,the ways technology has been useful during the pandemic and some of the ways it has been problematic during the pandemic.,2,"I can go. For the negatives on us, there's definitely been, it's the exact same thing just way too much screen time for everybody in the family, not just for the kids. You just kind of find yourself kind of, especially at certain points of the year when locked down was stricter, just bored. And so, all of us are on our phones or in front of the TV or on the computer.And my two are 14 and 10, so for the 14 year old, he's already kind of going through those teenage mood swings. And I have found that the extra screen time hasn't helped, like on days when he has less screen time, he's in a better mood overall. When he goes over a certain amount and he's just kind of a dick. And then, it's also been like disrupted sleep and trying to figure out what the best time to cut it off is so that they're not staying up too late and they're able to fall asleep without being all edgy.On the positives, both of my boys have ADHD and while they're both really smart, like getting them to focus in class has always been an issue. While they've been home and everything is laid out on the computer, their grades have skyrocketed, they're both currently on principal's list. Both of them have had nothing but nineties throughout the year. And I know a lot of parents have struggled with that transition to working from home.But for us, it actually worked really well because I was able to be like, ""Hey, let's put you in a quiet environment and there's no distractions at the moment and you sit there and I'll sit here and do my work and you sit there and you do yours. And if you need help, you let me know."" And because it's quiet and there's nothing else going around, they've been able to focus, so that's really been great for them as far as just grades.And then, the other one as a family that we've enjoyed is because we're not going out as much, the one time that I really do enjoy the screen time is when I'm like, ""Hey, let's do family movie night."" And our pod was us and then my mom and my aunt. We'd do like a whole thing. We'd bring down the screen, we'd make popcorn and it would just feel really great to sit there as a family and have our own little moment where we were all connecting."
media_group,3,3,1,the ways technology has been useful during the pandemic and some of the ways it has been problematic during the pandemic.,1,"I guess a couple other things is to add what to people have already said is the positive has been things like I've been able to go to PTA meetings and stuff, which I wasn't able to always attend in the past. And keeping in touch with, well, when the pandemic started, it seemed like we were making more of an effort to FaceTime with family in India, and have all the cousins together.And now, obviously a year into it, that's lessening a little bit. But in the beginning, there was this wanting to get together and actually FaceTiming people, which we hadn't done in a long time. And then, the negative is obviously the endless addiction that people have talked about, but also this concern that, are they going to be able to function as like normal humans like you and I function? Or do the only way they know how to communicate with their friends is when they have a phone in their hands? There's this fear that this kind of alternative way of communication has seeped in."
media_group,3,3,2,"I want to start with in terms of your children and their use of technology for education, the first question we're focusing mostly on prior to the pandemic, what was that like?",2,"Sure, for us, prior to the pandemic, most of their technology use for school was at school. They didn't bring, like they have their Chromebooks, they didn't bring their Chromebooks home, generally. They use pen and paper for their things. Sometimes they'd have to look things up on the computer, but it wasn't the larger part of their schoolwork at home. But now, it's the complete opposite. If he's writing, if either one of them is writing anything down, it's actually surprising more than anything."
media_group,3,3,2,"I want to start with in terms of your children and their use of technology for education, the first question we're focusing mostly on prior to the pandemic, what was that like?",3,"Both of my sons have an IEP with assistive technology. My 16 year old is actually very adept at using a computer beforehand and his school was already using Classroom about a year ahead of time. For him, it was a pretty seamless transition and like Parent 2 said as well, with ADHD, for him, for my 16 year old, it's been an improvement being at home. Sometimes, being in an ICT classroom is great for kids with ADHD, but sometimes it can be tricky because sometimes you have more disruptive kids in there and makes it a little harder for him to concentrate. On that aspect, it's been better. And my 11 year old had been given assistive technology, but had never really been shown how to use it. He didn't really use it at home at all. But now, he could probably run a small tech company. They've gotten very good at it."
media_group,3,3,2,"I want to start with in terms of your children and their use of technology for education, the first question we're focusing mostly on prior to the pandemic, what was that like?",4,"My high schooler was already using the technology, so he's using it even more now. Whereas, I think it was with my middle schoolers, it's like Parent 2, it was like more pen and paper for him. And now, yeah, he, I barely see him using pen and paper, he's mostly on some device for his schoolwork"
media_group,3,3,2,"I want to start with in terms of your children and their use of technology for education, the first question we're focusing mostly on prior to the pandemic, what was that like?",1,"Yeah, the same for me, the pen and paper has disappeared. And personally, I consider that a loss because I just feel like their going to forget how to write."
media_group,3,3,2,"I want to start with in terms of your children and their use of technology for education, the first question we're focusing mostly on prior to the pandemic, what was that like?",5,"With my son, it was a natural transition. There wasn't much of a transition cause he was already using the computer to write all his reports and even well, the math is of course still pencil and paper. I don't think he's doing that. I see him doing that on paper still and then he takes snapshots of it and sends it to the teacher. But otherwise, it wasn't much of a transition at all. He is doing very well in school, too, but no real transition."
media_group,3,3,3,"in terms of using technology during the pandemic, what was that like for your family?",1,"Well, they were on screens pretty much all day, like they logged on at 8:00 or whatever, then whatever school ended 3:00 and then they just stayed on doing homework or God knows what else. But they were just in front of the screen from 8:00 to, you have to like sort of drag them away for dinner. But it was just all encompassing."
media_group,3,3,3,"in terms of using technology during the pandemic, what was that like for your family?",5,"It just seems like they're on the computer all the time. And you don't really know if they're goofing off or not, as long as grades are okay, I guess he's doing what he has to be doing. We kind of let him do his own thing."
media_group,3,3,3,"in terms of using technology during the pandemic, what was that like for your family?",2,"I'd say for us, the experience is just pretty Similar. I mean, the little one is in class starting in at 8:30. Really, we get them up and we start, they have Zoom classes certain times throughout the day. And then, during the rest of the day while he's not in Zoom classes, he has assignments that have to be completed and turned in preferably by 4:00. We'll get them up as early as 7:30 so he can start getting the work out of the way. And once he's done with that he's like, ""Hey, can I go watch this?"" Or, ""Hey, can I go play a video game?"" I'm like, ""How about you try to read for a half hour first and then, you know, give your brain a break from the computer?"" But it's essentially the same for both of them is they jump on first thing and then it's pretty much straight through the day unless you rip them away from it."
media_group,3,3,3,"in terms of using technology during the pandemic, what was that like for your family?",4,"My middle schooler has a regular day, so it's just all online. He starts at 9:00 and ends at 3:00. He's basically, with the exception of the lunch break that he gets, he's in front of the screen most of the day. And I think just like Parent 1 said, it kind of evolves from one thing to the next, because then even after school, he's still in front of the screen, whether it's doing homework, chatting with his friends or playing video games. I find myself having to come in and make him take breaks away from the screen, whether it's just go eat something or just go to the bathroom. I don't know because yeah, he'll just sit in there while my high schooler, his schedule is different. But I feel like he manages his time better because he has to go from his regular high school classes and his College Now classes. He has two different schedules to follow. But I think for my middle school, it's just been harder to kind of get him away from the screen."
media_group,3,3,3,"in terms of using technology during the pandemic, what was that like for your family?",3,"Yeah. We have I'd say a Similar thing. Our high schooler has kind of figured it out and manages his time well. And the tricky thing for our older one, our kids first got phones in sixth grade and we had one computer in the living room that everyone could use. We haven't been able to do that with our current sixth grader. He's gotten a lot more screen time a lot more quickly. He got his first phone starting in sixth grade, but he certainly has much more access to screens than his brother did at the same age. All the sort of safeguards and things we had in place for our now 16 year old are out the window with the 11 year old.And he starts class at 9:00, but he'll get up at 7:30 in the morning to play Minecraft or Subnautica or whatever before school starts. And so, okay, he's getting up in the morning, he does that. But it's a lot of computer time during the day."
media_group,3,3,3,"in terms of using technology during the pandemic, what was that like for your family?",6,"I find that it's harder for me to control what they're doing, especially those well, I have a four year old and I have a 10 year old. One is in fifth grade, the fifth grader is a little more responsible as the kindergarten, pre-K say, my four year old son. My four year old son would not stay still. He would not want to be in the sessions and he would cry, whine and we're having a difficult time sitting him down for more than what? Maybe they meet like an hour. That's been tough."
media_group,3,3,4,what challenges do you all anticipate in your children going back to school full-time?,2,"For me, I worry about because they were both ADHD, they both already kind of struggled with connecting with their peers. And so, there's been almost a full year now where they really haven't connected with kids in their own age. They just recently started going back to Taekwondo for in-person classes, so they're starting to see their peers and stuff, but I worry about their relationships and making friends.Especially for my oldest, he started, this was his first year of high school, so when he goes back in September, he'll be going into the 10th grade. But he was already going in without knowing anybody, so I worry that he will especially struggle to make those connections and know how to carry out conversations in person and how to hang out without a screen in their face."
media_group,3,3,4,what challenges do you all anticipate in your children going back to school full-time?,5,"I have the same concern with Parent 5, Child 1 right now. I know he's struggling with that at school. He goes to a boarding school, but they have the option to stay home and do Zoom also. And he actually, for the first time, he's very... He used to, well, he's always been very sociable, but this is his first year in high school, too, so he changed from schools, too. He went into a school where he knew nobody and then just half the school is actually there in person.And about a month ago, he asked to come home and I said to my husband, I go, ""This is the first time he's ever asked to come home. He's always loved being in a boarding student."" And I found that very strange. He wasn't talking to us very much. I found that he was isolating himself a lot, but he's going through that teenage period. You're like, ""Okay, is he just going through a phase?"" And it finally did come out that it was the social aspect of the school that he was just feeling very lonely and very isolated. And I think because everybody is on their screens everywhere and they're not socializing. I think it's going to be an issue, I think, with the kids overall, whether they have problems or not."
media_group,3,3,4,what challenges do you all anticipate in your children going back to school full-time?,3,"We don't let our kids do traditional social media, no Facebook, no Instagram, no anything like that. Again, I did find it a lot easier to do this with my older son. My younger son is on YouTube a lot. As much as you try to monitor it, they will always find a way around it. There's just no, there's just no way. And the worst is Discord. We've found discord to be incredibly problematic and really, really hard to monitor. And the tricky part about it is, it is, I think at least for my sons, it's like the main way kids were communicating with each other, because you can be on a group chat with your class with your advisory, with different things, so it has functional uses. You can't just say, ""No Discord,"" which is what I would like to do.But, having to constantly monitor all the different threads on Discord and trying to figure out Discord because I'm not a big social media user myself, so trying to figure out that stuff and what's okay to use and what's not. And my son also struggles being social, so I didn't want to cut off a social avenue. But I really, really dislike Discord."
media_group,3,3,4,what challenges do you all anticipate in your children going back to school full-time?,2,"I would say I'm very Similar to Parent 3 in that sense. I didn't let the boys get phones. The little one got a phone now because of everything going on. But Parent 2, Child 1, my oldest didn't get his phone until his his 14th birthday this past summer because it was like, well, we gave it to him as an early graduation gift because he was going to be going to high school and the high school was so much further from our home than where his middle school was.His middle school was a 15 minute walk from our place, the high school, he's actually going to, when he goes in, person is actually like a train ride and a bus ride away. At that point, we gave him the phone so he could get like phone numbers for all his friends that he wanted to stay in contact with from middle school and that kind of thing. But we had a strict no classic social media, no Facebook, no Instagram, no Snapchat, none of that.And we told the older one that when he got his phone, if he was interested in Instagram, because I felt like, okay, it's a little bit easier to monitor Instagram than it is some of the other social media you can get and he wasn't interested. But now, as this time has gone on, they've been interested in Discord and it actually started with group play on things like Roblox and stuff like that. That's how it started for them. But it is a lot harder to monitor. And the little one, not so much that he's 10, so there's a lot of YouTube, which I'm not crazy about, but at least I can sit in the room and kind of keep an eye on the YouTube with them and see what he's watching.But the Discord is really, really hard to keep track of and is kind of a concern for me because like, ""Who are you talking to? Who are you?"" You know what I mean? Like you're meeting all these people in these rooms and you're communicating and he's like, ""Oh, I made a friend and you know, wherever, and they're my age."" And I'm like, ""That stranger danger talk of internet stuff is like consistent."" Like, ""Hey, remember they're saying they're your age, but you're not seeing them in person. Anybody can say anything. You know? It's also, be careful about what you're putting out there. You know, just because somebody asks for X, Y, and Z doesn't mean you have to whatever. Don't give pictures of yourselves, don't give locations of yourselves, that kind of stuff."" There's a lot of whole new world for me, stepping into this because it pushed it forward so fast."
media_group,3,3,4,what challenges do you all anticipate in your children going back to school full-time?,4,"Yeah, I feel like we're having a Similar experience, too. And I feel like my younger son has had just way more access to social media in comparison to my older childs now with the pandemic and they're big video, big PlayStation gamers, so they have a lot more access than I'm comfortable with, but we've also had to go over the not giving out your personal information, not giving, putting your business out there with these people because you really don't know them.And also, just talking about just being caring, being careful, being cautious, not everybody's your friends type thing, but yeah, there's a lot of access with the YouTube, with the gaming. They're not on Facebook, thankfully, but they're on other things, they're on Instagram, they're on TikTok so it's just, I'm very concerned about the younger one because I feel like he's still trying to figure things out while at least the older one didn't, wasn't exposed to these things until more recently. But he wants to do everything has big brother's doing, the younger one, so that's been a challenge for me."
media_group,3,3,4,what challenges do you all anticipate in your children going back to school full-time?,1,"Yeah, just chiming in, the Discord is an issue for us, as well. It seems to have taken over and he seems to be communicating kind of nonstop to this universe out there. And again, can't really monitor what threads, what rooms or whatever that he's in, but he seems to be almost, I mean, tied to the hip to this, to this Discord. Like he seems to be responding every couple of minutes to some kind of message board or something. And I've never seen anything like that before. And that's really, really concerning, like it seems to have taken over his life."
media_group,3,3,5,"what are your thoughts on as we return to in-person school and in-person activities, what your children's use of either social media or things like YouTube and Discord and other things on their devices will be like?",2,"For us, I figure we're probably going to have a little bit of a fight on our hands. I'm already trying to push them more towards like so for like the summer I got my older one to apply to and enroll in two different activities. And they're both going to be Zoom, but it's Zoom with like people, you know what I mean? One is almost like a book group that he's gonna join. And the other one is a coding camp type of thing. And it means less time on things like Discord and stuff like that. I figure while it's not in-person, at least it's, it's interacting. It's more like this setup versus just typing in a chat room and being in front of the computer screen by yourself. And I've already been pushing him to do that now.I made him join a book group that he goes to twice a month and it's always like a fight because he's always like, ""Well, I'm just doing this on the computer."" And I'm like, ""No, shut it down and go join your Zoom.:"" I figure that if I'm having that much trouble with a 45 minute thing once a week, I can't imagine what it's going to be like when I'm like, ""Hey, go hang out with people."" Which is funny because like, when I was growing up, it was my mom going, ""Stop hanging out so much."" And now I'm like, ""Go outside, go meet someone, like take the train or something."" And I worry a little bit because it has engulfed him so much, he is so comfortable and settled in that I know it's going to be difficult to pull him away from that.I'm like, ""Do something, like you're not doing anything, you're sitting there watching somebody play a game."" It drives me crazy.And then, of course, they're like, ""Mom, you just don't understand."" And I'm like, ""You're right. I don't understand [crosstalk 00:52:07].""My 10 year old is here and he overheard that and he's just looking at me like... Get out of here, God away.He's like, ""It's just because it's fun."" I don't, I don't, put your earphones back on and watch your movie.One thing that we did for us that has been sort of working is at least one weekend day now that the weather is starting to warm up for the last two or three weekends, we've gone out for the day. And all they hate it. They hate it so much until they don't. But I'm like, ""Hey, we're going to go for a walk and we're going to go to this bookstore and we're going to maybe we'll grab lunch somewhere and let's go to the park. And even if we just sit on a bench and you know,"" and so for a few hours, depending on how long, this past weekend, we ended up staying out much longer than we expected. And we were all exhausted, but it also kind of felt so good because we were outside and not in front of a screen.And at first they were like, ""When are we going back? I was hoping to get on a game with my,"" and I'm like, ""I don't know. I don't know if we're going back anytime soon."" But it's helped.Yeah, I don't know. Like, I don't know if we're returning, it's never, we're never going back, but it kind of by the end of it, they were talking and, ""Oh, look at this and hey, you know, can we go here?"" And I was like, ""Yeah, absolutely. You want to go to Barnes & Noble? Yeah. I'll take you to Barnes & Noble. You want to look at a book? Sure."" You know? I'm like anything to like, keep you from being in front of a screen and to have you physically moving. And so, that helped.And I was like, ""Hey, maybe next weekend we can find someplace with like an easy hike, because like we're all like stiff and unused to moving and have like an extra 15, 20 pounds. Like all of us like from the littlest to the oldest, we're all just like round now."" And I'm like, ""Maybe we can start walking and get some of that roundness out."" And they're like, ""Yeah. Okay. I guess."" But at least I can get them to try it. They're not crazy about it, but they'll do it, so it gives us something that's not sitting in front of the screen."
media_group,3,3,5,"what are your thoughts on as we return to in-person school and in-person activities, what your children's use of either social media or things like YouTube and Discord and other things on their devices will be like?",4,"I agree with that. I give you a small example, like if it was my son's birthday, this is the younger one on Saturday. And I was like, ""Okay, so why don't we go out, go eat."" He loves hamburgers, so I said, ""Let's go, let's go to a burger place.""And he was like, ""No, I just want to stay home and play with my friends online."" And I was like, ""Oh, my God, that broke my heart."" I was like, ""Dude, we need to go outside, get some fresh air."" I had to force him just to take an hour outside, get some air, eat because like he's just breathing internet. I just feel like going back to school, that that transition is going to pretty intense, pretty difficult because they just want to be online all the time now.I agree. Right now, my son goes to school in person one day a week and I'm always grateful for that day. Not only is it a break for me because I don't have to be on edge and feel like I have to keep checking in to make sure he's on the right screen, not kind of being distracted by other things. But I think it makes, it forces him to kind of be around the other kids and talk. Because he really has no interest in doing that.I think back to when he was younger and getting speech services, how they'd always talk about things like pragmatics, that, that reciprocal conversation, the eye contact and like that's gone with all the devices and everything. It's something that kids are going to have to almost relearn once they're face to face, on a more consistent basis."
media_group,3,3,5,"what are your thoughts on as we return to in-person school and in-person activities, what your children's use of either social media or things like YouTube and Discord and other things on their devices will be like?",5,"Yep, they're not very physical anymore. It's very, very hard. You have to bribe them, trick them guilt them into it. It's a challenge. It's a constant challenge every day, trying to get them to be physical and go outside and look at the sun, sit out there and get some vitamin D. It's very hard.I think it will be a challenge. I know Parent 5, Child 1, I was kind of surprised, he actually verbalized, ""Mom, it's not the same talking to someone through social media as it is to talk to someone in person."" He knows it's not like a true human interaction. There's some kind of falsehood to it. A lot of pretend going and there's not as much work in that relationship through social media, as there is through a real face-to-face relationship with somebody.That was good that he actually is knowledgeable of that difference. How he'll interact and face-to-face is a big question because like I said before, he wanted to come home. I don't know whether the kids that he's socializing with are having the same issue, that nobody is socializing with them or is he having the issue, socializing with others? That's my question. Maybe it's a little bit of both from both sides.I have. I've asked about his friends, like who was he hanging out with? What do they do? What are their interests? Like I said, he just moved from the middle school to the high school, so all the kids are different. I mean, there was not one kid that's going to the same high school as he is. It's a whole new school to begin with, but everybody's starting in the ninth grade, so they're all coming from different areas of the country and going to that school.They're basically all in the same boat together, but it seems like social media did, has done something to, I don't know. It's very difficult for these kids to interact, to really interact. I go, ""What do you all do in the evenings?"" He's like, ""Oh, well, you know, like his roommate gets on the computer."" He's a big techie guy and Parent 5, Child 1 tries not to, but it does, it's really hard not to when everybody else is in their rooms doing something on their social media."
media_group,3,3,5,"what are your thoughts on as we return to in-person school and in-person activities, what your children's use of either social media or things like YouTube and Discord and other things on their devices will be like?",3,"We have a Similar issue with our sixth grader. He started a new school this year, middle school, and he was the only one from his elementary school to go to that middle school. And there were a number of students that have come sort of in large, larger groups from other schools, so there are kids that do know each other, even though everyone is starting sixth grade.But, and I do find that that's often used as a, I would say a point of manipulation if you try to limit Discord or screen time, like, ""Those are my only friends, it's the only contact I have with people and you want to take it away from me."" And, and there's, I've done a lot of defensiveness around any kind of discussion that the internet may not be God given gift to humanity.We tried to watch a movie about, or there was a TV, like a 20/20 or 60 minutes or something about like screen time in America. And I was like, ""Well, why don't we watch this together? And you guys can tell me what you think."" And they're like, ""Oh, you just want to take away our screen time."" They were just like, wouldn't hear it, wouldn't even listen to it. Totally, this was like, ""You're old, you just don't get it."" And how important it is to us.""I'm so sick of it. They're days I leave my phone by accident and I'm like, ""Oh, it's so nice, like, this is what it used to be like and no one could reach you.""Well, what's interesting is I'm just now reading The Scaffold Effect, I was recommended because right. You guys were sending that out. And it's on the chapter on like screen use and it's like, ""Kids should only be you know, using the screens two hours a day,"" and I'm like, ""Okay, Mr. Koplewicz, that's not happening."" I'm like, ""Who is managing two hours a day?""I know, I know. Every time that like your average daily screen use, I'm like, I don't want to see it. I don't want to see it. I don't want to see my kids. I just, I don't need to see they're all averaging like 10 hours a dayI have to say I'm looking forward to them going back to school full-time. Just because I think that will naturally on its own decrease the screen time. As long as they were not just Zooming in class, which is so frustrating. But yeah, I'm definitely looking forward to them going back.Yeah, I mean, I think so many of the kids with the IEPs, all those services are just out the window. I mean, my son had his first year after years and years of trying to get them OT finally got it. And then, it was cut off last March and nothing since then. He was supposed to be an ICT class, that's not happening. And that's the other part is being in a position of being parent, teacher, screen monitor. It has not been good for our relationship. Having to sit there in his, and do my work in the same room that he's in, because if I walk out, he's not, he doesn't know what's going on in class. He doesn't, so I have to stay in the same room to make sure that he's at least in the Zoom classroom of the class that he's in.And so, like any independence that he would have gained this year has just gone. And now that he is going back hybrid, like when he's in school, nothing gets done. They've tried to do it so all work gets done during the school day and they don't have extra homework after school. But they said he's in school now, nothing gets done because he just, he doesn't have somebody sitting there again, ""Are you in the class? Are you on the right Zoom? Are you opening the right files?""Complete learned helplessness at home, which is entirely my fault, but I don't, I haven't managed to figure out that bridge of making sure he gets the information and understands what's going on, but is independent and can do stuff on his own. We decided on making sure he knows the information so that if they have to build on that information next year, but yeah, the independence, non-existent."

But in my opinion, and I guess these skills that they're learning are kind of necessary for their future. But in my opinion, I think the negatives outweigh the positives.And I'm going to ask you a question. Maybe we're the dinosaurs here, maybe the moms in the group were the dinosaurs, and this is gonna be the new pParent 3digm and this is going to be how their brains kind of transform and I don't know, societal habits transform and work this fighting it. I don't know. I'm unclear about that. But I just, I know that I don't like the direction in which it's going."
media_group,3,4,1,speak a little bit about if technology was used for educational purposes before the pandemic? And did you find that beneficial? Did you have any concerns before the pandemic? Since Corona has technology been used for educational purposes? How do you find it beneficial? And have you had any concerns on the technology side of things? ,2,"I feel initially my daughter went to Sea last year and so initially they were used to doing they had online setup, St Joseph by the Sea, and it was going great. And I feel they did a wonderful job and at least the kids were able to continue learning.
	But as we came to this year and she transferred to Tottenville, it's honestly ridiculous the way they're doing it because you are either at home or you could do blended. And blended a Tottenville means you go sit in a classroom with your computer, just like you're at home because all the teachers are at home, and the kids are in school. So they sit there with their headsets. I don't know what story is there with teachers, and I love teachers but I'm so fed up, they don't want to go back. And they're learning nothing. My daughter... I feel this year has been a complete wash. She was an 85 to 90 student now she barely passes a class, because she just has no motivation. On top of that she had major knee surgery two months ago, which that I guess made it good because she still could do the work, but I don't feel they're really learning anything. Sea did, Tottenville had to learn how to do it, which I guess they did between last year for them was a total waste because there were kids who just didn't know what they were doing. This year they know what they're doing. But it's just, number one it's either the teachers keep too long in the class or not long enough. And some of the work is just so ridiculous that they have to do and sometimes it's a lot. And sometimes it's just, I don't know, it's different because they're doing classwork and homework at home. If you're not motivated to start out with it's not quality stuff at all."
media_group,3,4,1,speak a little bit about if technology was used for educational purposes before the pandemic? And did you find that beneficial? Did you have any concerns before the pandemic? Since Corona has technology been used for educational purposes? How do you find it beneficial? And have you had any concerns on the technology side of things? ,5,"Yeah. Similarly, to some of the things that Parent 2 said, although we've had a different experience both my kids had been using collaborative online platforms before the pandemic, which always seemed to be of benefit to the way that it was operating.
	And, obviously there's the benefit that this had to happen in terms of any kind of continuity. But in both cases, I think the meaningfulness of it, or any kind of robust engagement with education has really diminished. My 15 year old had a complete depressive breakdown last year, and including with hospitalizations for depressive incidents, is now at a therapeutic boarding school where at least he's there in person. So we had to have something very dramatic happen through all of that. I think that these things were underlying before but I think the circumstances around a pandemic exacerbated and accelerated this and it was certainly not helped by the pivoting to completely remote. His school, Brooklyn Tech, was just too big I think to be able to handle it meaningfully at all and so that that was a big thing there for us. 
	And then my middle schooler, my 12 year old is really struggling, again it makes such a difference when he's able to be in person, his school is now gone to three days in person out of a six day cycle. It hasn't been able to be consistently implemented because of different cases and having to shut down from time to time. But when he's there in person, they're teaching in person, and he's a different kid. And now they hadn't been doing fully asynchronous learning before going to that platform, they had been teaching classes on Zoom. So now, you see those three days, I'll take it because I see what happens when he's there in person. But the asynchronous stuff is really not useful. It's very rote, package assignments that they dial in, it's not engaging and I would agree I think he's regressed over this year."
media_group,3,4,1,speak a little bit about if technology was used for educational purposes before the pandemic? And did you find that beneficial? Did you have any concerns before the pandemic? Since Corona has technology been used for educational purposes? How do you find it beneficial? And have you had any concerns on the technology side of things? ,3,"Hi, I'd like to say that for before the pandemic, my older girls the ones that are in middle school, they knew how to work the laptop, they have phones and stuff, but they weren't 100% sure how to use the Google Classrooms and all that the programs for the actual educational material.
	I was a little bit upset about that, they were depressed and ""oh my god, I'm not going to get it done right."" And they weren't and to my knowledge the teachers weren't even uploading the material correctly. So they weren't getting a lot. They lost out a lot last year in terms of education really, nonetheless, they didn't have in person classroom. We started With just remote, then we did blended learning that was like not really.And they don't know how to do their own work, upload it, they're using Calendars which is important for day to day personal progression.
	The little one lost out most of all, she was in Pre-K. Very tough. I'm still working full time. I have to sit by her side while I'm working, while I have a call. And it was tough for her because she didn't know how to turn on the laptop, she didn't know how to upload her work, she still doesn't know how to upload her work it's hard to leave that responsibility up to a little kid that's four or five. 
	In comparison to this year, I can say it's like 70% better than last year because I think that the public education is a lot more prepared than last year in terms of trying to keep up the par with the classes, more on schedule versus links that are broken and not working. They're a little bit more lenient With the kids getting their work in on time, they enable them to do better by giving them small group sessions via Zoom. And that's great because for example all my girls, all four of them, they're fully into going to school in person.
	And I could say the difference between that and before is just in general my kids were like, ""I don't want to go in and what we going to do and they're still zooming."" [inaudible 00:23:22] But they came home and they were so excited just to see other kids or their teachers and their peers and stuff. So just seeing that made a difference made them want to honestly go back to school in person there are teachers they to tell you, ""hey, why don't you have a pen?"" Or, ""do you need extra help?"" It's better when they're in person, there is a difference."
media_group,3,4,1,speak a little bit about if technology was used for educational purposes before the pandemic? And did you find that beneficial? Did you have any concerns before the pandemic? Since Corona has technology been used for educational purposes? How do you find it beneficial? And have you had any concerns on the technology side of things? ,4,"Yes, hi. I will start with my youngest he had a really difficult time adjusting as did everyone. But more difficult than my other two kids of a similar age. And he's just returning maybe three weeks ago to a month ago, he's just returning to school. They started out two days Monday and Tuesday and now they just set up to... He was struggling as far as not being able to meet with his other classmates and teachers.Yes, for the full week they just started although this was their first week back last week. I think Wednesday they had a flood so then they didn't finish the week off. So they had to do Zoom classes Thursday and Friday and they're going to go back tomorrow. They're starting a full week so they're going to go back Tuesday.
	But it seems like they had a lot of filler rather than content as far as learning and one of the parents at the school had even text in to the other parents saying, ""Do you think that the school seems to be falling off?"" Because of the way they were teaching, I don't know why it went there, but they did a lot of videos more than learning things they were doing videos and dancing and things when you check in to see what they're actually doing at home on the Zoom classes. But he's back now and it seems there's a difference even in what he's learning.
	But he was also dealing with I think Zoom burnout because he would tell me, ""I'm sick of going on Zoom, I want to go to school, I want to see my teachers, I want to see my friends."" And so it hit him very, very hard. My daughter, she's 15 she was in a gifted program and she was just really let down and saying that she worked so hard and now everything she worked for was kind of just falling through, she felt. And she's also just resuming going to school she goes three days out of the week. And it seems to have a better impact on her actually being there because she was in the house and she's home and doing Zoom. She does the Zoom but then once Zoom is over, all three of them they all just want to be in their rooms. They don't want to come out. I have to try to engage them and take them places and do things with them so that they will come out of their rooms. They just want to be in the room.
	And my 17 year old, he I would say was doing better with the Zoom at home than at school because, I don't know, he just had issues of attending all his classes. But I still have to be on him at home because even though he's at home, and he's right there sitting at the desk, there are times when he can find other things to do on the computer and not be in the class and he's telling me he's in the classes and I'm checking, ""I'm there, I'm there."" And then teachers are calling me telling me, ""Oh, he's not in the class."" So it's been kind of a struggle but he's doing better than he was physically at school."
media_group,3,4,2,"what was your experience with technology for education before the pandemic and how has that changed and concern, benefits?",1,"Well again I have two children one is 10 and the other one is seven. So 5th grade and 1st grade. So first off my older one didn't really use the computer that often before the pandemic but he likes using technology. So somehow he was happy when it did happen, going remote, and the one thing I like and again my son, the older one has an IEP, he helped me out.
	So to have a better idea about what was being done at school and how he was doing it. So I was more on top in being a to assist him. The draw back is that sometimes the teachers would make comments and tell him you didn't do this right but there was no follow up because one teacher was teaching remotely, the other one was doing in person. So I would say it did affect him because he was not getting the support he used to. So finally when they were able to go to blended learning he was fine with it but when he, two or three weeks ago, had to go full day, five days a week, he wanted to go fully remote because I think that he's started to be challenged. He has a hard time with writing so he felt overwhelmed and that's why he wanted to back off a little bit and go fully remote because he thought it was easier.
	And my younger one, again I had to be next to him to connect him to all the meetings and printing the documents and so he had a lack of motivation somehow. I mean he would listen to his classes but getting him to do the work, the assignments, was sometimes challenging. And it's the same this week he started going back five days and it's hard to get him in, he became a homey person."
media_group,3,4,2,"what was your experience with technology for education before the pandemic and how has that changed and concern, benefits?",5,"I would say I would love to see most of these tools go out the window for a while as we go back. I'd really love to be able to see them start to work collaboratively and engage as people in person. Obviously we will still have those supports of the technology but I hope that we can start to use it as support tools and not the over-reliance on them that we've had. And I understand that I said the other day to be able to have something that is more functional and he was saying and the rote stuff. 
	While some of the others were talking I think the thing for my 12 year old he's happier when he's there in person, but to move from that but shift it's so easy for him to now just slump all day long. And because it's all on the one platform or the one tool and when I'm working all day long and can't be checking up on him rather than going down and doing the same thing. It all just become this one little suck and it is very easy for him to be distracted and to switch to surfing the internet, or watching a video, or playing a game. So, I would just really to be able to move to actual instruction."
media_group,3,4,2,"what was your experience with technology for education before the pandemic and how has that changed and concern, benefits?",3,"I think I would to see technologies stay and if it will be mandatory, it should be blended. Technology should always be there as a part of the world and the way we move each day, and it should be mandatory and implemented within the school system and they should learn how to use it day one when they go in. They should know how to turn on the laptop or upload something, the key things, the main stuff, which they weren't taught. They should have enacted force and I don't think they did. So they use these things and they don't know how and they don't fully know how to do everythingNo, it was here you go, this is it. Maybe they sent a video. I don't know, something."
media_group,3,4,3,challenges you anticipate in going back or parts of technologies you'd like to see stay or go?,2,"I guess I anticipate a lot of anxiety, my daughter she struggles with anxiety. Parent 2, Child 1 is my youngest. That's what I'm talking because everybody else seems to have younger kids. So she is already getting so nervous about having to go back. Meanwhile, she's not doing what she used to do because she said it almost becomes you feel schoolwork is optional. I mean because she's on the older end so it obviously is different than with the little ones and she's really getting so nervous. And she's dying to go back because she rarely sees any friends or I do believe all the kids from the younger ages they should start teaching, they should have the technology because that was the good thing about Sea is that they had a program, because they didn't do snow-days. So they had it totally set up so it was not such a big deal going remote. 
	But even with my other children my 18 year old started he graduated in last June so he started CSI and he ended up dropping out. He did first semester he did okay he struggles with anxiety a bit too and OCD, so I had talks with him, ""you can't drop out"" because now he withdrew too late that we have to pay now for the semester that he didn't do but he just couldn't do it, he was going nuts. My other son, thank God he goes to a Dayhab where it's very small so he's still going. 
	And my other daughter she goes to Dalton. She's in her third year. She's very smart but she's neurotic, her grades are so good it's ridiculous. So good, and she's still doing very well, but she doesn't like it either. Right now she does two labs in person so it's two classes a week. I don't know, but naturally she's going out now a bit there and socially. I don't even know there's just so many, this whole thing has just been very not good all around. It doesn't help anyone, I know we have to worry about the getting but... we all actually had the virus in January. But anyway.It doesn't help anyone, I know we have to worry about the getting but... we all actually had the virus in January. But anyway.Yeah, it's been so long. Next year she'll be a Junior, Parent 2, Child 1, and she's never ever been in the school. I mean she's been there with my other children but she's never been taught in that school. So, she's anxious about that too."
media_group,3,4,4,"can you talk a little bit about how your kids used media and TV before the pandemic? Did you have concerns before? Was it beneficial before? And now during the pandemic, how are your kids using media and TV and do you have any concerns or have you seen any benefits from media and TV?",3,"Like I say my kids before the pandemic, didn't really watch TV or any news or anything like that.
	A lot of the times they will watch Netflix, or they go on social media or like this TikTok thing and stuff like that. So whatever they hear is from on there, or from friends, and group chats. Other than that, they don't really watch the news so they don't really know of what's going on there unless there's a discussion about it within the house or they hear something from the social media. For really they're just singing and dancing so I can't say that it's really affecting them in that way, they just know that they're in the house and not really going anywhere because of this pandemic, that's all they know.No, I can't say that it has.Well for us now I mean only because now the weather's getting nicer I don't have the issue with them watching as much, TV or whether they're playing videos or watching TV and stuff. Because the weather is nicer, they're more active. Three of the girls are closer in age and they hang out together, they'll go bike riding, we have a pool they'll go swimming. They'll interact with each other where they're not watching the TV and they don't want to know what's going on because they're just together around each other, and they're still younger, they're not wanting to go out and party and all this and that. Well, I don't have that issue yet."
media_group,3,4,3,"can you talk a little bit about how your kids used media and TV before the pandemic? Did you have concerns before? Was it beneficial before? And now during the pandemic, how are your kids using media and TV and do you have any concerns or have you seen any benefits from media and TV?",4,"I would say my kids are they watch TV, a little more than they did before. My youngest son, he was more a outdoors person, and now he's just like, I have to tell him you can't watch TV so that he isn't on there 24/7, because he would be if he if you didn't tell him. He's on YouTube and videos, anything he could go 24/7 just in front of the TV.
	My oldest son 17 year old. He has set up video games on each floor, in his bedroom, in the attic and on the first floor. Just so that he can have, if his brother is in the room with him then he'll go downstairs and hook up with the video game. He just has it set up so that he can be on any video games, almost like 24/7 if not that videos. My daughter she's in her room on her TV, and I don't know they have some kind of way they have video games on the TV where she's here and they're jumping around Dance Revolution-ing. But she's more into the news so she will come and tell me, ""Mom, did you hear this?"" I mean she's always engaged in what's going on. She will come and tell me that but I think they're just a little bit too much into the TV since they've been shut in. Yeah, too much, too much. I have to get them to do things so that they're not around the clock on it.It's a positive thing it's not really overwhelming. It's not overwhelming or depressing her or anything but she just lets me know that she knows what's going on asking me do I know, constantly updated.I'll just say, I just think the weather definitely has an impact. We had the first warm day and I mean it was really nice that day my son got up.
	He's the outdoor guy. He got up he got on the scooter, he left and went around the block, on his scooter, masked up and went around the block and came back home. That following day, it was cold so I just assume that he thought that it was gonna be beautiful that day he went out in his t-shirt. I mean he actually went around the block thinking I guess, ""it's going to be nice so I'll go a little farther."" But he came back and he was freezing because he just can't wait to get out because we've been chatting for so long now. But I think a weather will definitely have impact on everybody because they want they all want to be outside.My oldest son he goes out and walks around the block every day. He takes the two year old that's on his back, he just has to get out he just can't stay inside. "
media_group,3,4,3,"can you talk a little bit about how your kids used media and TV before the pandemic? Did you have concerns before? Was it beneficial before? And now during the pandemic, how are your kids using media and TV and do you have any concerns or have you seen any benefits from media and TV?",1,"Yes, we don't have cable but we have access to like Netflix, HBO.
	Again what I was controlling before the pandemic was more their screen time. And what my older one, the 10 year old, does is more like Minecraft and their group chat was just with their friends and again I went from controlling one hour a day to now it's unlimited time. Because he has a harder time entertaining himself and then with a few parents, we were like okay they're playing Minecraft which is not too bad, it's not our favorite but it was constructive, and they were between their friends. But sometimes he goes out of control and it started to be the main focus of my son's life. If he wakes up he would just go to his computer so I tried to give him more freedom but at the same time I realized that it has to have its limits.
	And my younger one who's seven, somehow he's not watching too much TV but he I noticed that he went from educational program to now any type of cartoons. But I would say depends on the personality but he entertains himself more like he's more crafty and I realize sometimes he will point out that his brother is too much on the screen, and the reason why I gave a bit limited time is because it was creating a lot of struggles in the house and I think we all have enough stress around us."

Yeah we also have had real issues with the time where we had been able to exercise certain amount of discipline on screen time before and it just go thrown out the window.
	Certainly when my 15 year old, last year it became the whole night and day got completely switched. She was spending a lot of time, like either chatting online all night or watching movies or YouTube videos, stuff like that and that got things pretty out of whack. That obviously is being addressed because he's in an environment now where he doesn't have access to that. 
	And with the 12 year old, like still it's a struggle because he uses an iPad for school and he's always trying to switch off to watch a video. Sometimes he's playing the Nintendo Switch while he's watching a video, both things while he's supposed to be in school. Constantly having to go in and monitor that and take things away but during the day, I kept moving the switch out of the way that's what he's got. And a little bit of social media, I think with Minecraft and with friends, that's been a lot of the only way he's kept engaged with people that he knows, his friends and they're chatting that way on their Minecraft or some other video game.
	And both kids I don't think they consume in terms of TV per se, like again we have Netflix and stuff and NPR is always on in the background so I think they seem to be akin to what's happening in the world around. And surprisingly, sometimes I feel like 12 year old is maybe more aware of it than I think, he does ask questions about it. School seems to be pretty good at keeping discussions going on with current events. So, keep that I guess. I'd like us to be able to exercise more balance really. I feel like I'm half the time I'm shouting into the wind over it so to work with him particularly to have healthier balance."

And now during the pandemic, how are your kids using media and TV and do you have any concerns or have you seen any benefits from media and TV?",2,"I would say, social media and my kids they're all older and everybody has their phone, their computer, they did that. I do think that definitely watching more TV, but once again like Netflix, things like that and actually with my daughters it's been kind of nice because we went on binge fests of Supernatural and all these other kind of shows. So we spend more time together and have something to talk about that relates to use all.But that is something that I think, I don't know if it's Parent 5 had said about, the online and stuff my 18 year old son last year... because I think she's the one who had to go to the boarding school, whoever that was, my son who was watching these videos that he began to think he was cursed from watching these videos. And we were very close to having to send him somewhere because it's almost like he became suicidal, he became so obsessed, he couldn't eat, drink, sleep, about being cursed by, he saw like these doll things, I don't even know what it was but it was something. He's always had issues but it really, so then he wasn't allowed to go on the computer, do any of that stuff but he's crazy with the video games, he plays mostly basketball and stuff which I guess is, better. But anyway that's my story.I mean I would say the same with the Summer coming we did our yard last year, we have a nice big pool. Last Summer was really nice with that and the kids, so they're looking forward to that and definitely the rebalancing of time indoors versus outdoors so it'll be, I think good. We're looking forward to it."
