social_group,4,1,1,"how was technology used for educational purposes for your kids before the pandemic, how did that change during the pandemic, and what were your concerns before and during, or what were the benefits before and during? So does anyone want to start us off? ",1,"We broke it down within the positive and negative aspect but my daughter also has an IEP and I find that I, myself am struggling because I'm working from home as well and my daughter has ADHD. It's impossible for me to sit here from 9:00 to 5:00 and look at this screen and I'm continuously getting up. So she sits there from 8:00 a.m. literally to extra, extra help to 5:00 or 6:00. I'm sorry but it's impossible to sit all day here just looking at a screen. And it's not the same interaction. And I think teachers don't have a lot of patience. They're overwhelmed as well. Like I said, I have to keep reinforcing, telling her continue, what are you doing? And it's just a lot of me as far as I'm also working as well and I have another one that's learning downstairs, so it's a struggle but it hasn't been the same. And she's struggling in one subject which she wasn't before so it's hard",,anxious
social_group,4,1,4,"So let's actually shift the conversation now away from the educational use of technology and talk a little bit about gaming and how just playing games online has impacted your children. So if you guys could share how did your child use gaming before the pandemic, was it something that you had concerns about, and how did that change over the course of the pandemic",4,"So I would say that things are shifting now because more things are opening back up, so sports and dance and what have you are starting to open back up and I think we've all gotten to a place where we're allowing people, them to go outside and play with their friends. But to take a little bit of a different approach when we were early on in the pandemic and they could not safely go see their friends or be outside, even though I don't love the games and what have you, I did appreciate the fact that they were interacting with other children over the games. Because at least then as opposed to just sitting with the video game on the screen by themselves and looking at it all day, they were laughing and playing and yelling and getting excited because there really was no alternative at that point in time.

And since then as things have opened back up, we've gone back to having more conversations about when we have a choice, you always choose the in-person activity to get some fresh air. But the benefit to me during the huge crisis of the pandemic was that it did allow them to interact with other children and not just be completely bored and what have you all day. And [inaudible 00:45:58], I work in a hospital and my husband had left. He doesn't speak to my three children, so they have very long days home alone and that became a comfort to them in a lot of ways too to be able to interact with other children during the day",,serenity

You're like here's $20, or here's my credit card, go put $20 on for Vbox, I just ... [crosstalk 00:44:13] It's terrible",,disgust
lowpiu_group,3,1,2,"Thanks, Parent 3. Actually, you just gave me the perfect transition because my next question is as we do start to return and people are going back or have gone back, I'd like to hear from you guys about what challenges you anticipate chasing as your kids start to integrate back, if you think there will be challenges-",2,"Like I said, all my kids did go back already, but even my kids who did not like school before the pandemic were happy to go back to school, which I guess was a plus about the whole thing, even the ones who had the social anxiety. I have 12th grader. She hated school until this point. I'm not going to say she loves school now, but she appreciates it so much more, even the socialization which she did not like. She's just much happier. For us, going back to school was a tremendous benefit, and of course for our four year old who gains nothing. Like [inaudible 00:36:28] said, [crosstalk 00:36:29] home there's no [inaudible 00:36:31] school.",,joy
lowpiu_group,3,2,1,"So I'm going to throw the first question out there. So I'd like to focus a little bit on how technology has impacted your children's education. And so, if you could speak a little bit about how did they use technology for their education prior to the pandemic. Did you find it to be beneficial, did you have concerns about using technology before the pandemic? And then, since the pandemic, how have they used technology and what parts [inaudible 00:11:24] be beneficial, and what concerns have you had? So I know there's a lot of parts to that question, but feel free to answer whatever you like. So does someone want to start us off?",5,"I did have concerns before, because I've noticed especially my 10 year old has a really hard time transitioning away from technology, and kind of obsesses over wanting to check her email all the time, or see if somebody texted her back. And she doesn't even have a real phone. It's like an old Ipod that she can use as a phone. So for her, it's been more negative, because she kind of gets stuck and wants to always be on a screen. The one day, she has a DOE Ipad, but the one day she somehow played Lego Friends for seven hours. Like I don't know how it happened. I was working at home with her, but it just happened. So things like that were happening, that were concerning. That she was able to kind of circumvent whatever protection was supposed to be in place to keep kids focused on what they're supposed to be doing during the school day.",,anxious

So they are using technology at school, but it's more limited and there's more kind of person to person contact, so it's better now than when it was totally remote, like from last March until October.",,serenity

Five minutes becomes, ""Oh, two more minutes."" And it becomes an argument. So they really don't have screen time during the week, unless it's like a class they're taking and they have to use it. And on the weekends, there's more flexibility. But they're doing different things now, and I've noticed she's more into drawing now, or she'll sit and make bracelets. I feel like her personality is just one that gets kind of sucked into screen, so once we took it away, it was helpful for her.",,serenity

My main comment has less to do with amount of technology time, because my kids are a little bit older, not that that's an excuse. But they're going to be on social media for hours anyway. So, for me, being in school and using technology that way, sure it has increased the amount of screen time, but for me, what I've noticed, relatively anyway in our situation, is that school has, at least in my daughter's case, she takes it a little bit less seriously. Or had been, when there is no teacher there. I mean, there is a teacher there, but it is just, as we all know, one more removed from responsibility, from accountability. You can so easily instant message your friend and ask what the answer is. Not that she does that, but I'm saying, it's just wide open. There's a lot more kind of on an honor system.",,anxious

I however was one of the ones who raised my hand and said it's overall positive, because I guess that's a different question, but-",,anxious
