gaming_group,1,1,1,"So just starting to think through some of the impact of technology, can we talk a little bit about how your child used technology prior to the pandemic for school purposes?",1,"Yeah, so I have a similar experience with my eight-year-old. Pre-pandemic he was still in second grade so the use of computers was very limited. Maybe once a week he would type, words of the week was one of the options I picked to do. That was his only interaction with computer. Of course he had devices to play on, and he would go to his father's house every other weekend and he would be more exposed there to computers. But still he was busy. He was busy during the week, there was school, there was getting to school, getting from school, that's a trip in itself.",,serenity,
gaming_group,1,1,1,"So just starting to think through some of the impact of technology, can we talk a little bit about how your child used technology prior to the pandemic for school purposes?",1,"There was hockey, we had TaeKwonDo, he was very busy. Even then it didn't seem like enough, it didn't seem like we were doing enough but he was certainly a lot busier than now. And he did get to play, mostly probably on the weekends, and again, weekends were also pretty packed. So I don't know how he had time, but he did play, not a lot. And of course we were able to control it, it was an item you had to earn and if you didn't do well then you don't get to play. So it was a tool we could use as incentive during the week. So now that's all out the window, it's all available right there all day long. And getting him away from the computer now is a project in itself every day.",,joy,
gaming_group,1,1,3,"How the technology has changed during the pandemic, school purposes and whether it's beneficial or problematic?",3,"And then it was like a bomb went off, they figured it out, they figured out workarounds and it was like Pandora's box. I was trying to figure out how to block... I was on the phone with the DOE, I was on the phone with a parent coordinator, I was calling the principal, like, ""How can I block YouTube without..."" I was putting timer things, it was driving me crazy, and it was downhill from there. I finally figured out my son, by banging on it so much he's actually broken the screen so whatever controls I put in, he could bang on it and it would just do whatever he wanted. A month later I exchange the iPad but I nearly ripped my own hair out over this YouTube. Yeah, the addiction sunk in over those first five months of lockdown of screens and YouTube and just that misery sucking.",,anxious,
gaming_group,1,1,3,"How the technology has changed during the pandemic, school purposes and whether it's beneficial or problematic?",5,"And then there was also no schedule. Because we have some special needs in our family, my schedule is really tight with my kids and so the little guys we go to bed at 8:30 and then 9:00 and then the older one was in bed by 10:00 and there was a lot of structure, and literally it was like a bomb hit it. People were going to bed at 1:00 in the morning, it was just totally... It felt chaotic and out of control, and it felt like the technology sputtered for a little bit as we gt devices figured out how to get everybody on and then it was this black hole that sucked you in. And then everybody was on for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours, and it felt out of control.",,disgust,
gaming_group,1,1,3,"How the technology has changed during the pandemic, school purposes and whether it's beneficial or problematic?",4,"Yeah, I don't feel like there's even much to be involved.

gaming_group,1,1,4,Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?,2,"But even after my son started going back to school five days out of the week it still became a problem, technology, because right after they do their homework they will go on YouTube or they go on Roblox or something. I don't know what they're doing in the back. I have to tell them to go in the back because when they come home from school I still have to work so it still became a problem even though they're back in school five days out of the week. So yeah, and they still have some assignments on the computer, like homework assignments on the computer. Yeah, even if they go back to school I feel like it still would be a problem if you're having issues now with them remotely. So yeah, that's my experience.",,anxious,
gaming_group,1,1,4,Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?,5,"And my high schooler, I think it's interesting because even if he's the only one, which has happened several times, he goes when he supposed to go. I was like, ""You're going to keep going?"" And he's like, ""Yeah, I'm going to go."" And I'm like, ""Okay."" So I personally don't anticipate any issues. He's graduating, I think that's also part of it, because I think they missed out on their whole senior year and everything that they were looking forward to so just being able to go and see teachers and stuff like that, he I think wants that connection with people. So when he supposed to go, which is kind of like one day a week, maybe sometimes two days a week, they have this weird schedule that I still can't figure out, he's been going, he goes. So with my kids, they have bought into going back to school.",,optimism,
gaming_group,1,1,4,Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?,4,"Hopefully that will continue, but again, he will go to this program in September, he'll be in a smaller class size. Because I think the 32 kids that we've always had was overwhelming for him and he couldn't get along with anyone and it was just daily calls from school and nobody really ever addressed the issues that he had. It was always just like, he's that kid, type of thing. All the tears that were cried by me. So yeah, so I think... He actually even said the other day, ""Oh yes, I'm going..."" Because I remind him advance to prepare him that tomorrow is in person. He said, ""Oh yeah, I'll have something else to do than to play Roblox.",,optimism,
gaming_group,1,1,5,"Any positive parts you would like to see continue, or are there parts that you're really hoping would end as we go back?",1,"So the one teacher, who is... and not in a very formal way like his teacher, in a less formal way. So that's been amazing. So the feedback that I get from his two tutors that he has... And we haven't been doing it for a long time, maybe a month or so, maybe over a month, has been been great. Overall very positive. So I'm very happy because he did need help in ELA and math and was complete lack of participation in his Google Classroom. I didn't even know what he knew and what he learned any more this past year. So the one on one ability without having to go anywhere, get dressed, drive, so that was a great deal and I hope that will stay. And I hope it will stay because, why not? There's a demand and there's a supply, I think that would be one good takeaway, some remote learning options.",,joy,
gaming_group,1,1,5,"Any positive parts you would like to see continue, or are there parts that you're really hoping would end as we go back?",2,"Yes, having direct contact with the teachers and the schools ,instead of the school sending a bunch of print outs with the children in folders, that became overwhelming, all the paper. The teachers, they were able to reach out to me immediately. I mean, not that they weren't doing that before, but I think it became easier to do because it just became that platform that everyone was using. I believe my school, they use Class Dojo as a way to communicate. I think the platform that they used for the students in the school work was iLearn and I didn't really like it so I'm kind of glad...",,optimism,

They have a better social life. Because before they wouldn't talk to anybody but now they communicate, they keep in touch. But now it's just regaining the control back and getting them to understand that there's a time and place for everything and you shouldn't allow these things to consume your time. It's frustrating for me after a while. I'm like, ""Wait, you guys have been on the computer all day. No. You guys, no, it's time to give this a break."" Then they'll get upset and it's an argument.

So now I'm looking at software that I can block the whole thing down. I've put a padlock on where our desktop computer is, on the door, and she'll hide the lock. I'm like, ""Where is the padlock?""

In 2019/2018 we were both overwhelmed with all the papers that the school were giving and sending home. It was just overwhelming to even look at it. Now that everything is organized on the computer that he has from school, it's just a click away. It's either multiple choice, or fill-in, and he gets it done. 
	Now he's in high school and I feel that I can help him more. Meaning at the end of the quarter I can see what he's missing, and I can, myself, tell him, ""Parent 1, Child 1, get this done. You're missing this, this, and this."" I can sit next to him and watch him get it done, and check up on him. Also, I communicate regularly with his teachers to make sure that he'll pass on to the 10th grade. 
	In the 5th grade, he got left back. Yes, because it was just too much. Too much paper. Too much everything. Too overwhelming. In class, he would fall asleep. Here he has no choice. I'm here. I'm home. I'm going to be barging in his room like, ""What are you doing?"" I can check up on him. 
	I also feel like he likes it more. He doesn't... he has not complained at all about him wanting to go back to school. I do have him in hybrid, where he goes twice a week, which is good. He needs to get moving. He's a little bit husky. That's a negative that I find in not going to school. Not being able to mobilize and get your steps in. 
	Yeah... that's a benefit",,optimism,
social_group,4,2,2,"Now, my next question is as we do start to return more in person and as people are starting to go back to school... What concerns do you have?

Despite that, she's concerned because more kids keep coming back. First of all, I think they need to learn to be social in the manner that they were before. I think they've lost that skill. They have to re-find their comfort and figure that out. 
	I also think there's definitely an underlining sense of fear, or nerves, depending on the kid. For a kid like mine, it's fear. Some are just nervous about interacting in a close physical space even though there are masks, and some people are being tested and everything. An extra kid showed up in Math and they put all the seating closer together. Everybody in the Math class was so uneasy. Teacher and kids. They felt too close to each other because now they have this whole mentality that that's potentially dangerous. That's not going to go away in a minute. Next year they're all going to be back in school, and they're going to be closer together. They have to figure out how to navigate all that again, which I think is a definite challenge",,fear,

I do not allow them... I will not... That influence just has to stay out. It's enough. They get it on their WhatsApps. They get screen recordings of it. As long as at least they're not connected to another... and they're begging me, ""Why not?"" I said... for instance Snapchat, I have a friend who's daughter actually wanted to do plastic surgery because the filters make them look so much better [crosstalk 00:50:35].

[crosstalk 00:53:24] public, or in new places he doesn't feel very easy connecting to people. With social media he has that barrier of not being that face to face. I think he overuses it and it's affecting his sleeping. He sleeps in, then he goes to sleep too late. He's 20, I don't know how much I want to be constantly taking his phone from him. I do try to put restrictions in terms of, you have to get up by a certain time and if you stay up late that's going to be a problem. I can't tell him how and when to sleep, but I can make him get up and be productive in the morning as much as possible, including giving him a couple morning classes when it's time to help them sign up. 
	For My 15 year old it's really tough because I'm constantly finding him using it during school. They're still remote... for the most part they're remote more often than not. They just shut our school down again because high school has too many cases. I'm working from home. I'll take his phone and I'll tell him he can't have it until between classes, or after class. Then I'll go in there later and see it's in his room again. It's a constant battle. I feel like now I've got to be a control freak which I'm really trying not to do, and allow him to earn my trust, but it's not always happening. 
	It's sick. My husband says some of these countries have these technology addiction rehab places that [crosstalk 00:54:46] to a drug rehab [crosstalk 00:54:51]. It's scary because I honestly see my kids could be candidates, and I'm sure I'm not alone here",,fear,

	There's good and bad in everything. I'm going to sum that up like that. Social media can be a good thing. It can be used for good. It can be used in a positive light. Then again, it can also be a negative. It could turn in to a negative aspect. You have to really control it. Like the other parents are saying. I even agree with miss Parent 2 when she was like, ""All right. When I need my five minutes, you can be on phone."" Because I know that's going to keep you content enough for me to get my five minutes.
	Now if I be like, ""Give me the phone."" They, ""Why. What happened? What did I do? Why are you taking it? I can't look on this? I can't do that"" I be like, ""No, Genesis, you can't.

What's cat fishing, I have no idea. Somebody was trying to lure her. I find the reason I do so much filtering on their phones is because... it's like throwing them in to an open arena where anything goes. My 16 year old... I think she didn't realize what it was. I found it in her trash inbox. Not in her spam, but in her trash. All of these deleted porn email advertisements. She never [crosstalk 01:03:07].

	As far as anything... I understand what the woman before me was speaking... she said about having a voice, but they also feel a pressure to have a voice. To have an opinion. To state their feelings.

How do you think that disorder has impacted their use of devices during the pandemic?",1,"I mean, I'll say, I think with both of my boys, my one son he's autistic. He has sensory disorder. I mean, he's high functioning. He has anxiety, he has auditory processing, a whole bunch of different stuff. But he manages. And before the pandemic, he had his routine of what he did and it was good. He always has to have a schedule and know what he's doing. He'll do anything but as long as he knows it's something coming up, if not, he gets thrown by that. So the whole COVID, the restrictions just made it more difficult for him to figure out what to do with his time. They had all kinds of Zoom classes or sessions. He goes to the [program]. He does Respite Hab. And at that point, that was all he was doing.
	And he doesn't like Zoom. He's very overwhelmed by Zoom. You know how people, even you can see when you go on these meetings. Even me, for instance, I was on another meeting yesterday and I couldn't figure out how to mute myself and my dog wouldn't stop barking. So there are things in the background that he just really won't do any of them.
	His dayhab, thank God, it's a small one. He went back at the end of August. And except for a few days here and there closing down, they've been open the whole time. So for him, that's great. And then my son, Child 3, who has his other issues, being on social media, I mean, he's always been on it a lot before. And during it just became his only thing. He didn't see any friends in person because he was afraid. And I think that's what made him constantly watching these things that were scary and made him afraid. Like Child 1's mom. I mean, not that it's good to hear that about someone else, but it at least kind of makes you feel like he wasn't the only one because it was the scariest thing ever to just watch him go through that. He didn't sleep, he didn't eat. He just was panicked all the time, saying ""I just can't take it anymore.""
	And I think that's what did it to him, going on these sites that he just became addicted to. And moving forward, now he goes out a little bit, he gets together. He's not an overly friendly person, doesn't have that many friends to begin with. So, I'm hopeful that the summer, he'll be out more.
