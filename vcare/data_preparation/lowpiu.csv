lowpiu_group,3,1,1,"Okay. Thanks, Parent 5. And then, Parent 6, I think that you're having a little trouble with your audio, but we'll do introductions when she comes back. Okay. The purpose of this group is to learn a little bit more in depth about how technology has impacted your kids over the course of the pandemic. You gave us a lot of useful information through the crisis survey, but this allows us to dig in a little deeper and really get some insights from you so that we can better understand the situation and really try to spotlight on what parents are experiencing.
	Just to start off, maybe if everyone could grab a paper and a pen, if you have one nearby, and just try to write down a couple of positive ways that you've noticed that technology has impacted your children since the pandemic and also try to outline a couple of negative ways that technology has impacted your children. [inaudible 00:10:25] have a couple down in each category, I'd like you to try to think which of the two categories you think have had a [inaudible 00:10:36] overall impact, and then circle which category has had the bigger impact as the positive influences or the negative effects had a bigger role [inaudible 00:10:49]. I'm hearing a lot of background noise from someone. I think, Parent 6, is that coming from you?",6,"I'd say the positive is obviously they've been working remotely from school, which they are still doing. We felt safe that they could be at home and on Zoom and listening to teachers, interacting with friends, trying to be a little bit social online and just being part of the classroom setting. I guess that was positive. I'm actually glad that they're home and they won't be going until September. We made that choice. Obviously, the negative effects of that is way to much time on the screen because they're on the screen throughout the day for school, and then they want their phone time on screens."
lowpiu_group,3,1,1,"Okay. So for the first question ... Well, before I get started, what we've seen is that a lot of parents have had a lot of overlapping experiences, and then we've definitely seen that there are parents who have more unique experiences or different experiences, and we really appreciate that everyone really feel free to chime in if you have had a different experience than someone else is saying. We really want to try to welcome all perspectives. I just want to start by saying that. For the first question that I'd like to put out there is just if you could share ... First, I'd like to focus on education and how technology has impacted your children's education. If you could share was technology used for education for your kids before the pandemic, and then did you have any concerns about it before the pandemic, or did you find it beneficial before the pandemic, and then how did that change once the pandemic hit? Would anyone like to start us off?",6,"Well, I think technology with kids these days is always a part of education, even for research or doing some assignments at home and sending them in. I know for my kids it was always there, but since the pandemic obviously everything now is done via technology."

Are you asking if it's a positive change?"

He sits in his room, never comes out, [inaudible 00:18:27] and just very focused. He's actually doing better academically."

It was just a production of how do we get on, what do we do, how do we use [inaudible 00:19:07], the different moving parts just to educate your child, be on top of your child with ADHD. Two of them which one of my children has emotional issues and the other one is just all over the place. It was pure hell back in March, and working full time from home trying to get it to happen. That's when my husband and I had made a decision that if our kids are like this, maybe they need medication. We started going down the medication route and started our kids on medication this year in September. The medication actually has helped them a glorious amount from September to be able to be focused to be able to learn, to not talk back as much and what have you. The pandemic did that to us. We had been holding off for so long."

Would anyone like to start us off?",2,"Okay. I think I'm probably taking the other side of what most people said. I hated online learning. As I said, I have seven children, and you can imagine what was going on in this house, seven different devices, eight different devices because my husband was working from home too. We didn't even have them. My daughter runs down, she starts kicking my husband off the computer, ""I'm late for class,"" and he is talking to a patient. Thank God our kids all went back in September. One kid had to quarantine for two weeks because someone in her class got it, but other than that, they've all been in school and we are so grateful for that because the online learning was terrible. My daughter who's five now, but she was four when the pandemic started, a four year old gains nothing from online learning. Even when she went back to school, she wasn't in every day, I didn't put her on the day she was on. I'd rather take her to the beach or take her to the park and give her real-life experiences where she's gaining as opposed to just watching the screen.
	My high school kids hated it, my teenage girls, because the social interaction wasn't there. They were texting in the middle of classes. Someone said to me, ""You're going to let them do that?"" I said, ""Well, they talk in class. Let's be real. They need the socialization."" I did let them text during class. Overall, I don't like to get my kids online, I don't like the texting, I don't like the phones, and it made it much harder to limit it. My 13 year old was ADHD, he was playing Lego during class. He couldn't focus. Some of the teachers were just not understanding at all. Some I felt were much stricter than they would've been even in the classroom, and it was just very difficult for my kids."

There is a silver lining. I'm very busy. I teach and I tutor and I do a lot of freelance marketing because that's my background. I had to splice away all of that, and so the negative is the income became significantly last, but I've also lowered my expenditure, shall we say, and I got to spend time with my son. I felt like I didn't rely on the school system. I got to see my son in his way. I learned how to work with them and we still are. It's a work in progress. I actually changed his school amidst this pandemic. It provoked a lot of sleepless nights, I didn't know whether to do it or not, but being the ADHD where he's [inaudible 00:25:23], I experienced a lot of what other people said about ...
	He would get on, but these pockets of time in between was disconcerting. I couldn't handle it. I'm a single mom. It just felt like Jekyll and Hyde pulling and pushing. And then, in the beginning a year ago in March, April, it didn't feel like remote learning at his former school. Even though it's a wonderful school, it felt like assignment learning. They just stacked on the assignments. There were times we would just spend until midnight completing one assignment because in between, we'd just be running around the apartment, there were just so many tantrums. It's their way of reacting to this pandemic and the sudden change of environments. I get it, but I actually put them into a school. It is structured, but not as negative as what people say. People do know the school system quite well. I'm actually rather impressed. They have them in school from 9:00 to 3:00 full time, non-stop. When they're doing their work independently, they're still logged on."

It has to be fully remote, but what they've set up is this full system on the Chromebooks and they use a platform called GoGuardian where there's three teachers by the way in the classroom and they watch as the child is doing the work. The silver lining here is that I feel like there's more one-on-one [inaudible 00:27:12]. I have to say, I'm a teacher so I'm really honing in and learning and seeing what they're doing, how they're carrying about. I was rather impressed with this engagement that seemed more in the moment, live."

As a result, my son's grades have increased while the sacrifice of socioemotional is there also. With ADHD, I feel like there's this ability to focus because ADHD involved processing, and so this ability to hone in on the screen has been really wonderful. Also, we started the medication process as well. The silver lining here, which this is my last point, is that I was able to work on the medication management, so I had actually really good data to provide to the psychiatrist and what have you. When he goes to school, and they're starting school in August, August 2, they're cutting the school year end of May, and then the school is starting the school year the ninth of August after he comes back [inaudible 00:28:34] because they feel like there's still a learning loss despite this structured system, and so they're starting school early the second of August. I think he'll be more prepared all because of this time that we had, although it's been [crosstalk 00:28:54]."

We were away with a friend for two weeks, and she goes to one of the great high schools here in New York City, and I hated how they taught. She was all over the place, and there was no accountability. She would log on, but then she'd be texting, [inaudible 00:29:32] breakfast, she was loud. I'm like, ""How is she learning anything?"" This was Clinton. She goes to Clinton. Whereas my son, he logs on and he has to be on camera. If they ask a question and he does not answer or respond, [inaudible 00:29:49] and they have to have a reason why. He's had a lot of accountability. My middle schooler started very light. To me, they weren't doing enough, but they progressed and they seem to be doing a much better job. I was just really [inaudible 00:30:06] the difference between two high schools. My son knows he has to get on, he has to be on camera, he has to participate, he has to give an assignment some time, or we get text, we get notified.

He has to put the password in and turn it on and open up the internet himself, which he was able to do on an iPad, but now he's fluent with a PC for example. My other son, his class is fully in person. He's the only remote student. This has been very interesting. A positive for him is that my middle son has auditory processing disorder, so I've been able to observe how he learns, make ... What? No. Not you. My daughter ... I'm sorry. She said I haven't spoken about her. My four year old had just started nursery school when this all happened, but she was not connecting on the Zoom, not because she wasn't able, but she does not like speaking and not being acknowledged.

With Parent 3, Child 1, we'll see how it shakes out socially though because he is a loner by nature and also he is on the spectrum, and so socializing is not his favorite thing. He's been able to give into his tendency to just want to be alone with an iPad, which is a downside. We're hoping that we will smoothly transition back into in-person school in September and he'll be able to reconnect with all of his friends, right Parent 3, Child 1?"
lowpiu_group,3,1,2,"Thanks, Parent 3.

We try to facilitate safe play dates outside with masks on, but it'll be interesting to see how Parent 3, Child 1 integrates back into an in-person world. I think this is his sweet spot.

I have 12th grader. She hated school until this point. I'm not going to say she loves school now, but she appreciates it so much more, even the socialization which she did not like. She's just much happier. For us, going back to school was a tremendous benefit, and of course for our four year old who gains nothing. Like [inaudible 00:36:28] said, [crosstalk 00:36:29] home there's no [inaudible 00:36:31] school."

My 14 year old always loved school. He really loved his middle school. He started a new high school that he has not set one foot inside, so that'll be interested when he just go back, but he loved his elementary and loved his middle school. My younger one, my 13 year old, was always the kind of kid if he could stay home, he would. He says, ""I have a stomachache."" He never loved school, but he did say to me a few weeks ago that he missed school, that he did miss going on. We've been out since March of last year too, so it is a long time. I was very surprised to hear him say that it is better to be in school, even though he's also very shy and it's not like he has a ton of friends in school, but I just think just being around kids their own age I think is so important."

Someone gets COVID and then it gets shut down. My daughter actually when she was six got COVID. Everybody in our entire house had to [inaudible 00:38:36] and this, that and other things. There's this sensationalized trauma of what is COVID and am I going to die. My kids really didn't understand it, the one that got it. She sneezed the other day, and they're like, ""Well, if your child has any sort of symptoms of seasonal allergies or something like that, you need to bring in a doctor's note to the nurse so that they're not going to be sent home for seasonal allergies.""
	It gets to a point where they called me because she complained of a cough or something. I went and I took her to the doctor's, I went and took her to the pediatrician's office. I got a note saying that there was nothing wrong with my child, so I went back to the school, I dropped her right back off at school, gave them a note and they're like, ""What are you doing?"" I said, ""There's nothing wrong with my child. Here. Educator, this is where she needs to be in order to learn."" Because they're trying to throw them off and to get rid of them because it's easier that way, because if they're a trouble maker or one that makes things a little bit more challenging, it's easier to have one less. Why not just have one less in the class that does that? That's really the way that I felt with her whereas her sister, they understand she has allergies. She's had a sniffle for the past seven months. It's not gone away. It's just the whole am I going to get it, can I get a vaccination, those sorts of questions are what [crosstalk 00:40:46]."
lowpiu_group,3,1,2,"Thanks, Parent 3. Actually, you just gave me the perfect transition because my next question is as we do start to return and people are going back or have gone back, I'd like to hear from you guys about what challenges you anticipate chasing as your kids start to integrate back, if you think there will be challenges-",4,"Yeah. I think I'm more nervous. Actually, we had a choice of doing remote learning versus hybrid two day versus five day. Being that this is a particular charter school, not all charter schools are the same, but this very good school laid down the policies just last week, and they basically create this model to incentivize the parents to bring back the kids to the school. Now, if a child has an IEP, and mine does being that he has ADHD and speech, so they're saying that the kids with the IEPs have to come back to the classroom. That's interesting for me because I was actually thinking of keeping them remote until he gets the vaccine.
	I'm very anxious to answer your question because my son is very fidgety even though he's on the medication. He's very fidgety, and he's very touchy. I have a feeling you guys know what I'm talking about. It's very concerning to me because we're all so germ phobic. I know that there are some kids out there who get it, and we can't even see, we can't even tell that they're sick even though they're COVID positive. To me, we don't know everything about this COVID virus, and so we don't know if maybe there are some hidden effects on the child that we will not discover until they're older. The lack of full awareness of the science and the epidemiology behind this is what's concerning me.
	Now, I'm actually getting ready mentally to have him back in school. It'd be good for him, although I'm very worried about the EF skills because I've actually been his support helping him organize like, ""Hey, you have an exam. Don't forget. Let's study."" I have access to information because I'm hearing everything and seeing everything, but this is going to be a transition. I'll just leave it at that. Thank you."

I can't think of what's coming that will be challenging when they go back to full class. That might be a challenge for her just because it's more kids and that might provoke nervousness, but she's been doing so well in person, and she's so excited about school now. She was hesitant to go to school sometimes pre-COVID. I think it's just a net positive. I feel very lucky."

Trying to get them off, trying to get them off Fortnite. With the additional screen time that they get, I think they thought they could get more screen time for the fun games, but it's like no. Even though you finished earlier, you finished school earlier, you're home, we're around the apartment a lot more than if you were in school, that does not equal more video game time. We've made a real conscious effort to still limit that and watch what they're doing and how much time because we still make them go out every day. They have to go, even if they take a walk. You need to get out even during the winter. We all need to go out, get some fresh air. You can't just vegetate on a video game. We've always been that way.
	Like I say, their expectations are like, ""Well, we're not commuting back from school. There's no after school, so we have more time."" I'm like, ""Well, that does not mean more time on Fortnite or just wasting your brain doing absolutely nothing."" It's a constant battle, but it's a battle we had pre-COVID too. They always want that five more minutes, five more minutes, five more minutes. It's worse now than it used to be because there's not as much going on, but we just have to be ... We're the parents, whether it causes a huge fight sometimes. We just got to stick by it and limit the time. Sometimes, on the weekend they may get more time than we would like if we're busy doing something, but we just set the rules and really try to keep it within a reasonable amount."

I'm a phys ed teacher, so when I was teaching, my kids would always try and come in and play and do the games that we were doing and that sort of thing. I found that my kids don't want technology at all on the weekends. Now, we've come up with game night, we've come up with physical activity night, and then we've come up with movie night. Even sometimes they don't even want to watch a movie because it is something that's just going to drain your brain or what have you. Through COVID, we were going for walks every single morning just so that we could wake up our brains to get ready to learn. In terms of that, I guess that was a good bonding, positive thing. They got a chance to see mommy in action teaching a bunch of kids, other kids [inaudible 00:48:46] acting silly.
	We have a Nintendo Switch. We've used it four times a year because it causes more fights than anything because they're trying to compete against each other when we're just trying to be together and create those sorts of values. I'm sorry for those of you who have kids who love the technology world, but it's been more of a family, so it was kind of good."

Pre-COVID, she was hardly ever on the computer. Now, I had to give her fun time on the computer every day. Once we switched to Zoom school, actually I started giving her 20 minutes a day of computer time where she could sit and watch something fun and whatever. That was very hard. When she started school again, I had to cut that back. I told her, ""No more."" We brought it back down to 20 minutes a week as opposed to 20 minutes a day.
	The funny thing is that I don't feel that more screen time necessarily contradicts with more outdoor time because when COVID started last March and the kids were home and they had some more free time between classes, my daughter learned to ride a two-wheeler, the other kid learned to ride roller blades. There was a lot of outside time as well. I don't know that they necessarily contradict each other, but we really do try to steer clear of the screen time, but everyone ... You're lucky, Parent 1.

He's not a picky eater. He's a problematic eater, so he's had a history of that since he was two and a half years old. His relationship to food is something that has to be focused on, even though he's eight and a half. It's a power struggle. Really, what it comes down to is it's a power struggle. He won't eat unless he gets to watch any. If I say no, then he's like, ""Okay. I'm not going to eat,"" and he follows through with that. Being that we're home all the time, that has manifested. We were really making headway with that, meaning where he doesn't have a device. He had support for feeding, even in the school it was arranged. Now, with the pandemic it's like he will not eat unless he gets to watch [inaudible 00:53:11].
	It's almost because he doesn't want to look at the food. You know what I mean? It's just his way of escaping. It's a sensory thing too, sensory avoidance. It's something that has manifested.

I thought it was important to still let him play it. I'm monitoring him the whole time, but this was a really great teaching moment for him. Thank, goodness. I shouldn't have said Among Us out loud because he hasn't played it in a month, but he's probably going to be on it tonight. That was the positive.
	As for Parent 3, Child 1, Parent 4, I think you mentioned the overstimulation.

Or had been, when there is no teacher there. I mean, there is a teacher there, but it is just, as we all know, one more removed from responsibility, from accountability.

Besides which, I can just do it in my pajamas. I don't have to do anything."" So he, in terms of using the computer now, he still is on the computer a lot, but he doesn't... Like he actually said something really interesting the other day. He's like, ""I started reading this online graphic novel, and I'm not playing as many games. Which is really crazy. I'm not playing as many games."" And I was like, ""No, that's great. You're actually reading, you're engaging."""

And she came home and was like, ""I might as well go back to school."" And she's been doing really, really well. I mean, but in terms of technology usage before and after, she's 21, she's always on her phone. My son really isn't interested in social media. But she is obsessed. So when she's not in class online, she'll be making Tik Toks with her friends, or doing all that kind of, like as you were saying Parent 6, all those sort of things that I'm like, ""God, I'm old. I don't understand anything."" But she also sort of introduced us all to Jack Box games, so it's like over Thanksgiving, we were able to spend time with out family who we would normally see, through these games and online through Zoom, like playing these games that are electronic games, that you can just have people sign into like you would Zoom."

lowpiu_group,3,2,2,"I had a quick question. So for Parent 2, I think it was on Monday, I'm not sure Moderator 1 if you were in that focus group, but there was one particular focus group, where all the moms were telling us about Discord.

They were talking about issues with cyber security, and the fact that schools have their children using Discord, but it has had a much more negative impact on their child. So Parent 2, of you, since you mentioned it, I wanted to know... And Moderator 1, I hope this is not like jumping the gun, but I just wanted to know, for you Parent 2, just your thoughts on Discord. Maybe because your son is older, compared to the other moms, if that is the reason why there's a difference in how Discord is being used. Have you had any talks? And this is for all parents as well. Have you guys had any talks about cyber security with your kids, using social media or gaming and things like that?",2,"Yeah, with my son definitely, because I think that a lot of the games that they play, they also have Discord chats. But he's also had some negative experiences on Discord, where he actually saw somebody get killed. And he was so traumatized, and I said, ""Listen, I can't police you 100% of the time. I'm not so much worried about you as what's coming into your world via the screen. It's not that I don't trust you, I don't trust other people."" And I think he was so freaked out by seeing that, somebody had sent it up in one of their chats. I said, ""You know, you stay out of those. You stay out of unmoderated rooms. You stay out of rooms that are for over 18, because you're 16. And just chat, only accept requests from people that you actually know in real life."" Which he has done. I mean, at one point, there was somebody that was trying to talk to him. I'm like, ""You don't know if this is a man or a woman. You have no idea if it's actually a 14..."" This is when he was 14. ""A 14 year old kid, or if it's like a 40 year old man."" I'm like, ""So you need to just kind of be very aware."""

So yeah, there is pluses and minuses, but I think now that he's older, he's a little bit more savvy. He knows to kind of stay away from things that are really going to mess with his head. And cyber security, I mean Zoom isn't... Like we're on Zoom right now, guys. And it's not all that secure. I do tell them to be aware, and don't hand out information, and don't tell people where you live, or don't do those quizzes and all that stuff.

And she's eight now, but she had really... She had watched movies with us, but barely ever used a computer. I mean, probably never independently before she had to kind of go to online learning.

Because I think navigating the physical world is a little difficult for her, it was more comfortable for her to communicate over Zoom. And she gave everyone tech help, and she's learned to make videos and make slide shows. She's gotten really into learning technology, in what I think is a very positive way."

She's just really into it, and we get to sleep in.

Would have been delighted to go back, would have been overjoyed to see her friends everyday, and have the normal high school experience again. But it's really been mixed. For one thing, it's exhausting sitting in class all day now. Getting dressed, going to school, having to navigate all the social stuff that she could block out before. So we've been talking a lot about it, about what is this... She's not in school full time yet, just two days a week, but we've been talking a lot about what it'll be like in the fall, when she has to go every day. She agrees that it hasn't been 100% great. She's even come home a couple times and said, ""I think I'll go back to staying home."" And she's an extremely extroverted kid, so this is not like... That was a big surprise to me."

So I don't know how that tied in with all of the Zoom school, and what's going on with the pandemic, but it just seems like that was increasing.

So stuff like that has been a challenge. And I think socially, it's hard especially for my 10 year old, because she is kind of in this one group of kids, and it's not a chance to mix with different kids, there's not different personalities. So that's really been a challenge. I mean, I think it'll get better as more people are coming back, but yeah.

So they're used to being out and about, and so to them, their schedule hasn't changed, because both of their schools have hybrid schedule. One of my sons, my youngest son's school only has a hybrid schedule. My oldest son's school, I think they do have a full time schedule, but even with the hybrid schedule, there are so few students in class, that it wouldn't make sense for him to have a full time schedule.

Parent 2?",4,"My younger son has sort of started to regulate things more for himself. But my oldest son has always spent a lot of time on his phone, meeting with his friends in the group chats and things like that. It's not different that he does it, it's just the amount of time. And again, although we're not on lockdown, his ability to socialize to the extent that he would like to, is still somewhat limited. So I just give him leeway with that."
lowpiu_group,3,2,4,"So you're seeing some leftover effects still, from being at home. So it didn't just go back. Anyone else have anything they'd like to share, about [inaudible 00:43:03] you anticipate, about as things start to go back to normal? Okay. So I think the last topic that I was hoping to discuss is to maybe shift away from the education focus a little bit, and I know people have brought up internet usage and social media usage through some of the other discussions. But thinking about... First of all, it seems like a few people here have been able to regulate usage, and haven't seen it turn into really taking over your kids lives.

Parent 2?",3,"I would say that for our kids, at some point I realized my son was like playing chess puzzles and math games, whatever games that his class had introduced him to, a lot after finishing his school work. And then I just made sure that he knew that I was totally available for him. Like if he wanted to play Legos, if he wanted to read a book with me or something. And I think just... And I've noticed that he kind of doesn't do well... Again, this week is literally their first day of being in school five days a week, but he was home three days a week this whole time. And I just notice that he stopped doing that, and he would just come seek me out. And I think also our kids are young enough, that we can just shut their laptops. We can just shut it down, and they'll just move on with the rest of their lives."

And instead, just kind of make sure that everything else was still totally available, and I found that our kids choose that most of the time, when it's available."

Parent 2?",6,"With older kids, again, I have almost no control over their technology. So I'm listening to these stories wistfully, because I would love to take away laptops, and even put programs on their computers or phones. As you said Parent 4, I think that train's left the station years ago, way pre-pandemic. But I also think that what's worked somewhat, a little bit, a tiny bit for us in the past, and I'm going to try to push going forward, is just to do the most obvious, basic thing, which is keeping as busy as possible. With other things. And whether that's chores, which is not a desirable thing, but get a job, or just push activity. And if possible, it would involve us too. Like actual fun family things. But that's not really what teenagers want to do, at least in my experience."

And everything else has kind of taken care of itself, including technology, and really a bunch of other things too. They kind of all fall into place if the kids are just too busy to get bored."
lowpiu_group,3,3,1,"I guess, okay. But we're going to get started and we'll do this quickly. It won't take as long because there's not as many people. So, hi everyone. Hold on a second, trying to load something. Thank you for agreeing to participate today. I am sorry that we are starting late, but as you know, there were not people on earlier. This is a short-ish focus group. I have a couple of questions that I want to talk to you about, but before we get started, why don't you tell me your name and about your child who participated in this study?",2,"Oh, okay. My name is Parent 2 and my eight-year-old daughter, Parent 2, Child 1, participated in the Healthy Brain Study because I wanted to participate in the study because I felt my daughter has ADHD. And once she went through the whole process and everything, it was diagnosed, she was diagnosed with ADHD and they suggested that I put her on medication and try different methods when it comes to her attention deficit, right? Because that's what it is, it's attention deficit. And she's hyper, so it's both. I have not put her on medication as of yet because at the time when all this was going on, the pandemic started and kind of put a hold on a lot of things."

This is a short-ish focus group. I have a couple of questions that I want to talk to you about, but before we get started, why don't you tell me your name and about your child who participated in this study?",1,"Hi, my name is Parent 1. I had actually two of my children participate in the study. Parent 1, Child 1, she was nine at the time, and Parent 1, Child 2, who was eight at the time. Parent 1, Child 1 was diagnosed with ADHD. We actually already saw a neurologist and we kept the medication the same. With Parent 1, Child 2, we had a diagnosis of ADHD and anxiety, which explained a lot, it helped us deal more with her behavioral problems because it was very different than Parent 1, Child 1's. But we didn't put Parent 1, Child 2 on any medication. Honestly, because with COVID, it was hard. Both of the kids were at home studying remotely and they both have paras in school, so they have a lot of support in their school environment currently."
lowpiu_group,3,3,2,Okay. So I just want to learn a little bit about what the experience of using technology before and during COVID was like for you. If you each can just tell me more about how your children used technology for educational purposes prior to the pandemic. Was it beneficial? Did you have problems with it? This is before quarantine started. If we can remember that far back.,1,"Well, before COVID, obviously they were going to school in the day instead of being home all day, so technology use was very limited. It was more our school uses a system called i-Ready for reading and math, so a lot of the homework was done through that. It's more like extra support, it's a diagnostic tool as well, and they used it this year as well. But it's basically, in school, they would do the diagnostic to see what level the kids are in math and reading, and then after that, at home, they basically, on their own pace, they had to do a certain amount of i-Ready a day, a week, it depended on the teacher, but it was between 30 minutes, or 40 minutes, or it could have been an hour a week in total. Each teacher did it differently. But that was really the only technological usage at home."

This is before quarantine started. If we can remember that far back.,2,"Oh, sorry about that. I'm going to say the same for my daughter. Prior to the pandemic, technology wasn't used that much unless it was to play games on the tablet or, I don't know, watch YouTube Kids or something like that. But throughout the pandemic and the remote learning, it was a lot of technology usage this year. I don't want to say that it helped. I think that in-person is much better than any technology offered, honestly, for so many different reasons. But I feel like the kids, they tend to get sucked into the tablets and the technology and then they forget about everything else going on around them."

If you each can just tell me more about how your children used technology for educational purposes prior to the pandemic. Was it beneficial? Did you have problems with it? This is before quarantine started. If we can remember that far back.,2,"No. I wouldn't say it was... It was hard to get her to stay focused during the class time, even though it was a short amount of time. She was in class from about 8:00 to 11:30 every day and it was a little hard to keep her focused. Just to sit in front of a iPad for that amount of time, it was a bit hard to keep her focused on that."

If you each can just tell me more about how your children used technology for educational purposes prior to the pandemic. Was it beneficial? Did you have problems with it? This is before quarantine started. If we can remember that far back.,1,"Yeah, our kids were full remote, so they were on technology from 8:00, about 8:30 in the morning, to about 2:00 every day, it depended on the school schedule. So they had things throughout the day, so I think they had about, on average, two and a half hours of live meetings on Zoom or Google Meets with the teacher or in small groups. And some time was given for i-Ready, which they kept using remotely. Some time was also asynchronous work, so to complete some worksheet or some kind of like... They also used, I think Pearson owns it, Savvas for their math. So they did that. The only real issue we had with technology was some of the apps didn't always work. So initially, we had the kids on the iPad and we noticed that the iPad wasn't as compatible with some of the programs, so it was very frustrating, so we switched them to a computer, a PC, each."

If you each can just tell me more about how your children used technology for educational purposes prior to the pandemic. Was it beneficial? Did you have problems with it? This is before quarantine started. If we can remember that far back.,1,"And also the parental controls on the PC because I've noticed that my daughters kept flipping back and forth because we had to have things like YouTube open because the teachers would use it in school and the kids would just watch YouTube for hours and hours and hours or they would play games like Minecraft and flip through it. So once we were onto it, we could ban or block certain things, but it wasn't easy because they were on technology all the time and it was six hours of that or seven hours of that. I felt like my older daughter did better, she's a little bit more self-reliant in her personality, so people distract her, so compared to school, she was really advanced and she finished really early and she did a lot more enrichment. My younger daughter, she struggled a lot more keeping focused, she needed almost like that physical school environment because she was distracted by the technology, all the apps that were on the computer."
lowpiu_group,3,3,3,What challenges do you think will come up as they go back to school full-time?,2,"I personally think it's going to be hard, it's going to be a transition. They have to get back adapted to the structure and the rules and the being in the class for so many hours. Just waking up in the morning, getting dressed, leaving. I think they're going to have to get used to all that all over again, so. And as far as the teachers, I don't know, I don't know what to tell them, I commend them though because I know it's going to be hard, you know."
lowpiu_group,3,3,3,What challenges do you think will come up as they go back to school full-time?,1,"That's funny because I'm actually a teacher, I teach high school, so it's been hard, the remote. So there's certain things I liked being a teacher remote versus in the classroom. But my older daughter, she's moving into middle school, so the transition shouldn't be too... She's already transitioning, so I feel like, for her, it will be easier. But my younger daughter, because she's continuing elementary school, I think she's going to have more of an issue with that structure. You need the bathroom at home, you just get up and go."
lowpiu_group,3,3,3,What challenges do you think will come up as they go back to school full-time?,1,"Food is better at home, those little things. She also got annoyed with other students when students would act inappropriately on the chat or call out. And I noticed that was the one frustration with the remote because she's like, ""I can't believe [inaudible 00:25:25] is talking over the teacher."" So I'm wondering if that's going to be a frustration more in the environment because that's something that's even... You have a lot of controls online, you can turn off chat, you can silence students, mute everybody.
	But she does have a para physically, so I think that's going to also help her because this year, because the para was also remote, it was all phone conversations. And I think she almost needed that physical organization. And I also think handwriting, everything was typed, everything was recorded, Flipgrid or anything else. But the kids didn't really write for 14 months, they didn't hold a pen for 14 months, so that's another transition. There's certain things, like the state tests, unless you have an accommodation where you have that writing accommodation, which we might really go for, but the idea that you don't even think about these things or the remote situation hinders it."
lowpiu_group,3,3,3,What challenges do you think will come up as they go back to school full-time?,2,"Well, my kids, they did some writing. I would have to go to the school, pick up books for them, and things like that, so. I mean, because I have a kindergartner, he was in kindergarten, and then I have my daughter who participated in the program. My son didn't participate in the program, my daughter's the one who participated. But dealing with them both doing this remote thing, my son didn't even get to start at the big school, as we call it, yet, so.
	But my daughter, she had all her IEP, she had speech therapy, she had extra special ed, I guess, it's special classes, special, extra alone time with a specific teacher that just works with her individually because of the ADHD. And if they had been in school for this school year, she would have got a lot of in-person time with whoever she needed to. But because it was remote, I feel like she probably didn't get as much time with everybody as she should have. So I'm excited that they'll be going back in September so that they can get the hours that they need, that they really need, or that they should have gotten this year but they didn't."
lowpiu_group,3,3,4,Do you have any other concerns or comments you want to make about what your children's technology use was like during quarantine?,3,"For me, I think the challenge and the thing that is more concerning is the emotional and psychological and self-esteem. I'm a single mom, I only have one child, but what I notice in general, and he's going on fifth grade, and he can't wait to go in person. But I think the curriculum and many other things, we can support them, but there's a part of them emotionally that I hope they have enough understanding and empathy around them to make them feel safe enough to express how they feel. That, to me, it's been one of my biggest concern."
lowpiu_group,3,3,4,Do you have any other concerns or comments you want to make about what your children's technology use was like during quarantine?,1,"Oh, I agree. It was very isolating for the kids. I mean, I'm lucky that the girls are so close together because they have each other to talk to, but they're still siblings, so they miss their friends. They were very isolated from other kids. So just even that interaction, even talking to other people. And I don't know about the long-term health effects too because I noticed that Parent 1, Child 2 did this weird blinking thing by the end of the school year with her eyes. And I'm like, ""Is that anxiety? Is that eye strain?"" But I cut them off technology after the school year was over and it seemed to go away, so I'm wondering if it's just that intense... When they're staring on the computer screen, they don't take breaks like adults. Adults might say, ""All right, I'm doing this, I'm writing this email, I'm going to take a 15-minute break."" The kids are just on it for seven hours straight, they're eating lunch in front of the screen."
lowpiu_group,3,3,4,Do you have any other concerns or comments you want to make about what your children's technology use was like during quarantine?,1,"Yeah, that regulation wasn't there. So definitely, that's that problem too. It was more like, ""We did school, now we want to go and watch YouTube or play Minecraft."" But it's like, ""You were on technology for six hours, you're on it for two more hours, are you kidding me?"""
lowpiu_group,3,3,4,Do you have any other concerns or comments you want to make about what your children's technology use was like during quarantine?,1,"Oh, we're actually traveling across the country. We're in Minnesota right now, we've been doing a road trip. So we left the tablets home. I only have my laptop and my phone to take pictures and the computer to book hotels and watch Netflix, but that's it. It is complete cold turkey and they haven't asked for it. The only technology they have is, I got them Kindles, so they're reading a lot, which is [crosstalk 00:31:10]. So we're going to keep that, that form of technology, but the Kindle is like a book, you can't do anything else on it."
lowpiu_group,3,3,4,Do you have any other concerns or comments you want to make about what your children's technology use was like during quarantine?,3,"So, I have a question and I don't know if this is part of the conversation, there's an incognizance for how our childrens are going to deal when the new year starts and how all this emotions and stress and anxiety may hit. And a lot of families don't have sometimes the opportunities, for example, to travel like that. And they still at home, they still in the city. How can we support childrens as we sort of moving into ""our new normality,"" but the childrens under 12 are the most at risk right now, not only for this new virus and all of this, but also the emotional?
	And I think we've been all living in a certain bubble, and yesterday, I got on the subway for the first time, and the subway got stuck in one part, and I literally, for the first time, I thought I was going to have a panic attack. So I'm thinking, I'm an adult and I'm able to control because I am a Buddhist, I meditate, I have tools. But I just got on the subway not even thinking how it's going to hit me. And I kept thinking about how childrens are going to feel and act when they go back to school and how can we support them without putting too much our own anxiety into them? I feel like childrens in many way have been my second heroes after nurses and doctors because they've been more resilient and more empathetic with this than sometimes the adults. But my concern is how we moving forward and how can we support them and catch little things to give them the tools or at least support?"
lowpiu_group,3,3,4,Do you have any other concerns or comments you want to make about what your children's technology use was like during quarantine?,3,"Because during this year, for example, I put my kid in this acting classes on Zoom because he's a fan of [Dogman 00:33:57] and I found this remote acting class and it was great. We go on the bike, we take walks, we read every day, a real book, for 20 minutes, I sit with him, one page him, one page me. I try to do anything that I can, but we've been in this bubble that we all have build the best that we can. It's like, what's going to happen in September?3"
lowpiu_group,3,3,4,Do you have any other concerns or comments you want to make about what your children's technology use was like during quarantine?,1,"Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I was going to say because I also have a teacher's perspective and I think that's why I left the city because we're avoiding cities, we're in the country, the kids are complaining about bugs. We're like, ""We haven't seen so many moths come out."" But it's part of the fun. But I think with kids being resilient in these [inaudible 00:34:53] September, it has to be a community working with the school and having a plan because I know they were pushing the social, emotional piece within my school and within the kids' school, so that has to continue. And it has to be a community effort because that's the bubble we're in, that's the pod we're in with those people, and how can we support each other.
	And I think also tone down the fear, I know the variant... I mean, I follow the news. The variant is scary, but just seeing life in the Midwest, people here are completely different than the city. I know it's a smaller population, the town we're in right now, it's like 1,500 people, but people are just living their lives, the kids are just running around. So it's interesting to see the different perspectives. And I think part of it is because we're from New York and we have so many people that live around us, so any outbreak is a lot more serious than in the Midwest. But it's just like, has this also consumed our lives to the point that we're not even living?"
