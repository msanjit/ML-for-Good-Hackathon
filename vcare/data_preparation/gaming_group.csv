Hi. My name is Parent 5. I have three kids, 17, 13 and nine, all boys. A good show that I started watching over the pandemic is called The Repair Shop, and if you want to see a show about nothing except things being fixed, it's a good show",

My name is Parent 1, I have two boys, a 8-year-old and almost 3-year-old. I think the most recent show that I personally watched with no children around was Schitt's Creek, which was amazing and helped me get through all these difficult times lately. I was a little bit late to the party, I started watching it maybe a month or two ago, but I could not stop. Even if the work hours were late, I had to make sure I'll catch an episode before I go sleep. With the kids, well with the older kid, I think a few months ago we watched Floor Is Lava on Netflix, which was fun to watch as a family. Besides that, I think my son watches lots of Marvel type things with my husband, which I don't participate in.",

My name is Parent 3 and I have an 11-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son. We don't watch television together at all, it's just for me. They Roblox with their friends and that's all they do. I've watched a couple of foreign things my friends have recommended, but I'd love to recommend a series, it's long but it's amazing, it's called Orphan Black. It's been around for a little while, it's produced by the BBC. It's sci-if and it's about cloning. It has five seasons. It's a real deep dive, but it's incredible and now it just won an Emmy. So I'll say Orphan Black, it's really great.",

What shows have I been watching... I've been watching a few things, but most recently I've been binge watching 9-1-1, it's a drama about 911 operators and I guess the LAFD and LAPD, and all the things that they go through. I can't say why would I want to watch that, I don't know, especially during these times. I have no idea why I watch, but it's just interesting and I learn things from watching it. But yeah, and then with my children, they've been watching Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, I don't know if anyone's familiar with that-",

My elementary school guy, he didn't have any homework on the computer at all. And my middle schooler had very little, like type this one thing or something like that. It was very little on the computer. And for myself, in terms of my family, I lock the video games so that there was very little access to video games during the week.",

Nothing like now, but definitely was using it. My middle schooler also, but not as much. They both did play games or use Instagram, my daughter was really into Instagram, not as much anymore but definitely games. Now it's just like a free-for-all.

Maybe once a week he would type, words of the week was one of the options I picked to do. That was his only interaction with computer. Of course he had devices to play on, and he would go to his father's house every other weekend and he would be more exposed there to computers. But still he was busy. He was busy during the week, there was school, there was getting to school, getting from school, that's a trip in itself.",

Even then it didn't seem like enough, it didn't seem like we were doing enough but he was certainly a lot busier than now. And he did get to play, mostly probably on the weekends, and again, weekends were also pretty packed. So I don't know how he had time, but he did play, not a lot. And of course we were able to control it, it was an item you had to earn and if you didn't do well then you don't get to play. So it was a tool we could use as incentive during the week. So now that's all out the window, it's all available right there all day long. And getting him away from the computer now is a project in itself every day.",
gaming_group,1,1,3,Okay. If you can walk me through a little bit how your use of technology changed through the pandemic when they had to start using it more for school or what your situation was for your child.,1,"I can say for my eight-year-old, because again, we went from not really knowing how to use a computer or how to type, to transition really smoothly, I mean if you can call that a benefit, we transitioned really quickly. He was typing away, quickly was able to navigate where to go to sign into a Google classroom. So, that was impressive in the beginning, how quickly they were able to adapt to that. So yes... I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?",
gaming_group,1,1,3,Okay. If you can walk me through a little bit how your use of technology changed through the pandemic when they had to start using it more for school or what your situation was for your child.,1,"Right, exactly, it seems beneficial because it is an important part of your life as you grow older in high school clearly, and in middle school as Parent 4 said, there's some use of computer. So at first it seemed like a good thing, and I'm sure it is a good thing, it's just, like I said, it's just become overwhelming use of technology because they sit in front of it all day. And another thing, this use of YouTube, because I understand teachers post some things that you can look up on YouTube, so you can't block YouTube because it'll be used as a tool for one of those classes they have.",
gaming_group,1,1,3,Okay. If you can walk me through a little bit how your use of technology changed through the pandemic when they had to start using it more for school or what your situation was for your child.,1,"But YouTube is just this bottomless hole of... I can't even begin, it's just so bad. And transition from looking at your Google classroom or your Google meet and here's YouTube, it's just so easy. And we were not always there, we still have jobs and other things to do, can't just sit on top of them. So this accessibility of technology that has this type of content, like YouTube, that's not beneficial for kids, that's been problematic, to say the least.",
gaming_group,1,1,3,Okay. If you can walk me through a little bit how your use of technology changed through the pandemic when they had to start using it more for school or what your situation was for your child.,5,"So for us, we only had a desktop and a laptop, which was more than sufficient pre-pandemic. And then everybody needed a device, all of a sudden everybody needed a device Needed to be on at basically the same times so we got one device from school, we bought a laptop, we found an old laptop. It was like the gathering of devices. And then teaching... My nine-year-old, teaching him how to use it, he really hadn't used computers in that way. And so teaching him how to use it. My middle son is prone to migraines and so being on the screen caused migraines and so that caused some aversion because he didn't want to be on.",
gaming_group,1,1,3,Okay. If you can walk me through a little bit how your use of technology changed through the pandemic when they had to start using it more for school or what your situation was for your child.,5,"The schedules were kind of crazy, like all over the place. And the truth is that it's hard because my 17-year-old, who knew how to do all these things just kind of stayed in his room for months. And it was just... I feel bad saying it, but he was kind of left to his own devices. He wasn't a big social media guy, he has no social media still, but when the only way to communicate with his peers became to use... What is it? Discord, and all these other things, that became the only way to communicate with people. And then it almost, I feel like... Like Parent 1 said, it's like this black hole that sucks you in.",
gaming_group,1,1,3,Okay. If you can walk me through a little bit how your use of technology changed through the pandemic when they had to start using it more for school or what your situation was for your child.,5,"And then there was also no schedule. Because we have some special needs in our family, my schedule is really tight with my kids and so the little guys we go to bed at 8:30 and then 9:00 and then the older one was in bed by 10:00 and there was a lot of structure, and literally it was like a bomb hit it. People were going to bed at 1:00 in the morning, it was just totally... It felt chaotic and out of control, and it felt like the technology sputtered for a little bit as we gt devices figured out how to get everybody on and then it was this black hole that sucked you in. And then everybody was on for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours, and it felt out of control.",
gaming_group,1,1,3,Okay. If you can walk me through a little bit how your use of technology changed through the pandemic when they had to start using it more for school or what your situation was for your child.,3,"Sure, when lock down happened my then first grader, the school did a great job pivoting to remote quite quickly. They used seesaw as a platform. I did get two laptops from the DOE because we have a lot of tech but it's all very old and kind of fragile and I'm like, they're going to wreck it all. Nothings insured. We're self-employed and I could just see the whole business being wiped out so we did take a DOE iPads which was a lifesaver. But also, again, we got to one point where the computer teacher did that YouTube... We were not on the YouTube and she sent one link and they figured out, ""Oh, I can get to YouTube from this link.""",
gaming_group,1,1,3,Okay. If you can walk me through a little bit how your use of technology changed through the pandemic when they had to start using it more for school or what your situation was for your child.,3,"And then it was like a bomb went off, they figured it out, they figured out workarounds and it was like Pandora's box. I was trying to figure out how to block... I was on the phone with the DOE, I was on the phone with a parent coordinator, I was calling the principal, like, ""How can I block YouTube without..."" I was putting timer things, it was driving me crazy, and it was downhill from there. I finally figured out my son, by banging on it so much he's actually broken the screen so whatever controls I put in, he could bang on it and it would just do whatever he wanted. A month later I exchange the iPad but I nearly ripped my own hair out over this YouTube. Yeah, the addiction sunk in over those first five months of lockdown of screens and YouTube and just that misery sucking.",
gaming_group,1,1,3,Okay. If you can walk me through a little bit how your use of technology changed through the pandemic when they had to start using it more for school or what your situation was for your child.,4,"Like I said, both my kids are on it all day. They're fully remote, both of them. Neither one of them has a full schedule so I hear my son... Because my desk is right next to his room, and I'm hearing him at like 10:00 in the morning, profanities on a game with his friend. And I'm like, I don't understand, it's a school day. Well, they don't have school, it's in between a break. So it's definitely made our day... Especially since I'm working right next to him, very difficult to try and do my job and be next to him. But it's their lives, they're in their rooms, if it's not school then it's playing games. My son plays a lot of games with his friends, my daughter doesn't but then she'll be on the YouTube also a lot, TickTock, whatever, and I kind of don't see them a lot during the day. Thankfully they do okay so I don't ask... I used to be a more involved and now I'm not really involved. Now it's a free for all.",
gaming_group,1,1,3,Okay. If you can walk me through a little bit how your use of technology changed through the pandemic when they had to start using it more for school or what your situation was for your child.,4,"Yeah, I don't feel like there's even much to be involved. They don't have much, especially my middle Schooler, has nothing to do so there isn't even much for me to ask him.",
gaming_group,1,1,4,Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?,4,"Absolutely. If you want, I can finish that. Actually I'm having problems now because my sons school said... We requested, they didn't say it, but depending on the size of the class you might be able to go in one more day. You can only go one day a week now. And I was able to get him in two days. And the fit that I got, screaming at me for five days until that day came, it was horrible. About how [inaudible 00:33:53] the worst, making him go in for two days instead of just one, so I can only imagine what's going to happen next year.",
gaming_group,1,1,4,Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?,2,"I'm sorry. My sons, they actually go to school five days out of the week. Initially we were blended and I had the same issues, the same issues with just constantly on YouTube, and constantly playing Roblox. When they were supposed to do their work I would go in and I would see them clicking out of the YouTube window. We received two laptops from the DOE as well, but before it was kind of limited because we had a desktop and we had a laptop. So before they had to take turns going on the computer if they were allowed to. They went on the computer but it was mainly on the weekends because they did play Roblox but not as often.",
gaming_group,1,1,4,Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?,2,"But after everything shut down I didn't have much entertainment to do besides television or talking with your friends or Roblox or Discord or whatever. Yeah, it just consumed a lot of their time. My daughter, who is three, I couldn't send her to the babysitter anymore, so she was home with me while I was working from home so I would have to force her to look at YouTube too, or watch the television. So I kind of really felt bad because I had to do that so I try to always turn on something educational, like Sesame Street. But then she started telling me what she wanted to watch after a while, Nick Jr. or Netflix, so that became a problem.",
gaming_group,1,1,4,Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?,2,"But even after my son started going back to school five days out of the week it still became a problem, technology, because right after they do their homework they will go on YouTube or they go on Roblox or something. I don't know what they're doing in the back. I have to tell them to go in the back because when they come home from school I still have to work so it still became a problem even though they're back in school five days out of the week. So yeah, and they still have some assignments on the computer, like homework assignments on the computer. Yeah, even if they go back to school I feel like it still would be a problem if you're having issues now with them remotely. So yeah, that's my experience.",
gaming_group,1,1,4,Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?,5,"For me, the months that I tried to work from home with my three kids was nearly impossible, like I'm sure many other people. So out of desperation, in September we decided to put my middle schooler in a private school, so he has been going five days a week with some interruptions when they close school, but there hasn't been that many. Today, I guess I got word from the elementary school that they're moving to a five day week model, I guess in two weeks. But my son has been going for two days a week since October with the school closings and stuff. But he is happy to go. He's looking forward to go. And my high schooler has also been going blended, it's interesting because sometimes...",
gaming_group,1,1,4,Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?,5,"And my high schooler, I think it's interesting because even if he's the only one, which has happened several times, he goes when he supposed to go. I was like, ""You're going to keep going?"" And he's like, ""Yeah, I'm going to go."" And I'm like, ""Okay."" So I personally don't anticipate any issues. He's graduating, I think that's also part of it, because I think they missed out on their whole senior year and everything that they were looking forward to so just being able to go and see teachers and stuff like that, he I think wants that connection with people. So when he supposed to go, which is kind of like one day a week, maybe sometimes two days a week, they have this weird schedule that I still can't figure out, he's been going, he goes. So with my kids, they have bought into going back to school.",
gaming_group,1,1,5,Anything else anyone is anticipating about the transition back to going in person?,4,"My son has been on a 2-3 day week model since January. Before that it was 1-2 days a week I think. But between all the quarantines and the school closures because of those two case rules that they had we were in quarantine all the time until... Hopefully going forward it will be better, but we were in school barely, mostly all remote because of all that. But we've gone a few times for sure. My son, he's on the spectrum so he has all these social/emotional issues that usually prevent him from being able to get along with children. All prior to the school year... We did start a new school this year, so in September we went to a new school that we've attended this year, which was a group of 7-8 kids, when he was in person because of the cohorts. So maybe that has to do with an overall positive experience for him on the days that he did go in person, compared to the prior years when he was one of 32 with all these issues that he had that we didn't even address until this year.",
gaming_group,1,1,5,Anything else anyone is anticipating about the transition back to going in person?,4,"And as a matter fact we just actually got placed in the NES program so hopefully next year he will... Even though it was a difficult decision to make because we just started a new school this year, new school next year, but I understand it would benefit him and sort of tailored to the exact issues that he has. But in terms of him going back in person, it has been an overall positive experience, he is not protesting or anything. He was able to even make some friends even though they're social distancing with masks on and everything. So I was surprised and happy about that.",
gaming_group,1,1,5,Anything else anyone is anticipating about the transition back to going in person?,4,"Hopefully that will continue, but again, he will go to this program in September, he'll be in a smaller class size. Because I think the 32 kids that we've always had was overwhelming for him and he couldn't get along with anyone and it was just daily calls from school and nobody really ever addressed the issues that he had. It was always just like, he's that kid, type of thing. All the tears that were cried by me. So yeah, so I think... He actually even said the other day, ""Oh yes, I'm going..."" Because I remind him advance to prepare him that tomorrow is in person. He said, ""Oh yeah, I'll have something else to do than to play Roblox.",
gaming_group,1,1,5,Anything else anyone is anticipating about the transition back to going in person?,4,"Exactly. So I think this is actually one of the silver linings for me with the pandemic, is kids that have issues, sort of like some of our children, when there's a big class size and one teacher and all that, they may not have a good experience I may not want to go back there. But so far, in our case, I think due to the smaller class size, due to having a little more, I guess, personal attention from the teacher who is able to expand herself for the seven kids, it was overall good. It was actually better than the years before.",
gaming_group,1,1,6,"Interesting. So I'm just going to move on to a different question before we focus more on gaming. So as we're going back to school I'm just curious to hear from people, are there any aspects of the changes in the use of technology that you would like to see continue as we go back? Any positive parts you would like to see continue, or are there parts that you're really hoping would end as we go back?",3,"The Google Classrooms, since my daughter has very little executive functioning, she has social anxiety and ADHD, just being able to use the chat function since she'll never raise her hand and she'll never ask for help. Using Google Classroom to directly reach out to the teacher and use the chat function has been fantastic. And then when she goes in blended she has more direct contact with the teacher. She goes in twice or three times a week with her cohort. So I like the Google Classroom set up for her as a sixth grader. Also, the smaller cohorts have been great. It's going to be, just to answer the other question, odd when it goes back to 32 kids. But I love that she can send a quick message, she gets a quick response back, and so that communication has really helped her a lot as an introvert and having those issues.",

It's probably recent, in the past month or two maybe, that we get a daily update at the end of the day for my middle schooler. I at least see what he's doing, which is probably more than what I ever got from him or the school, definitely from the school, before. So, that's nice to at least get a daily rundown of... It might only be a sentence or two each, but it's at least Something. So, that's nice. And I also like that they do get immediate responses basically from teachers if they have questions on homework or questions... Whatever it might be, but everyone is pretty receptive to responding in a quick time period.",

He would not participate. He did not reach out in the G chat message or whatever. So that part has not been working out for us very well. However, someone had an idea that I overheard, and so I found a tutor, just another teacher from another school who does tutoring. And so the ability to have tutoring at your fingertips without having to commute or travel, or go and wait and sit there in the car has been... And not just that, but the ability to one on one connects like this.",

So that's been amazing. So the feedback that I get from his two tutors that he has... And we haven't been doing it for a long time, maybe a month or so, maybe over a month, has been been great. Overall very positive. So I'm very happy because he did need help in ELA and math and was complete lack of participation in his Google Classroom. I didn't even know what he knew and what he learned any more this past year. So the one on one ability without having to go anywhere, get dressed, drive, so that was a great deal and I hope that will stay. And I hope it will stay because, why not? There's a demand and there's a supply, I think that would be one good takeaway, some remote learning options.",

The teachers, they were able to reach out to me immediately. I mean, not that they weren't doing that before, but I think it became easier to do because it just became that platform that everyone was using.

I think only the children who are remote use it, but I didn't really like it, it wasn't intuitive and I wasn't able to view the assignments, both of their assignments to make sure that they did it. And then some things they were able to do online, but somethings they had to print out, so it was kind of all over the place. So yeah, the only thing I would appreciate that they continue doing is using it as a way to communicate with the parents, that's all.",

She does other stuff online and is on there a lot, but as far as gaming, no. My son, the only positive thing I guess about it is we don't fight about it as much. I used to have to... It's not necessarily positive, it's kind of contradictory, but I don't even tell him to get off anymore. It used to be a fight because I used to have to tell him to get off, now we don't... So the fighting has actually gone down. The flip side of that is he's just on so much more. The language has got worse on the game and I'm constantly having to stop it. But he also has gotten a little closer with some of his friends that he can't see anymore because they're online talking. And the moms and I will say, ""Did you hear they did this,"" if there's a problem. I mean, he's definitely playing more, but he played a lot beforehand too, not like this.",

But this year it just blossomed, if it's the right word, he's playing a lot. I think some of it, again, may be my fault because it's a good babysitter. If you're trying to get through your work, we all have jobs, demanding jobs, it's easier to... instead of just standing there trying to control his gaming, you're just, ""Okay, he's busy and I'm going to get my work done.""

But in terms of positive, I also would echo what Parent 4 said, that he was able to connect a little bit more with his friends. And again, as I mentioned, he does have issues with social life, he has trouble making friends and doesn't use appropriate language with friends so sometimes they don't want to be friends with him, those type of things.

I would say it was just affecting their attention and they weren't focused so when I would punish them and say, ""Well, now you can't go on Roblox,"" they would get really upset, they would cry.

Because my parents live in Connecticut, so I moved the middle child, the first-grader, Parent 2, Child 2, to a school in Connecticut. They're full-time. It is amazing. If they do close, which is very rarely, they do live synchronous learning so I don't have to be their teacher, I don't have to step away from my work day. The teacher actually answers questions. My little guy's two, so he is in pretend school/daycare. 
	But Parent 2, Child 1, her school, she's still virtual for her school in Manhattan. They actually are back full-time, every grade now except for the pre-K, but I chose... She had been hybrid, and I chose to mover her to all virtual when they decided to go back full-time. The reason I did that was because of the six-foot rule, and even if it was the three-foot rule, which the UFT hasn't adopted yet, the entire second grade is in the cafeteria. So my dyslexic, ADHD kid, which is just the tip of the iceberg of her issues, is supposed to be in a cafeteria with every single second grader, no partitions, teachers using microphones, the specials are all still via computer. 
	So whereas, Parent 2, Child 2 in Connecticut is getting live special... She gets to go on a real playground all day, she has a first best friend, a second best friend, a third best friend. And Parent 2, Child 1 just would get to go sit six feet apart from a kid and have a teacher use a microphone while three other teachers are using microphones. It was just ridiculous. And with her issues and being further behind, we just figured... And she's not doing school at home obviously, but we're hiring tutors. So we're educating her, not our school currently. 
	I have said this morning I'm actually trying to get Parent 2, Child 1 into a private school for next year, so soon I'll be taking this call on the road because they called me this morning that they want her in for a math evaluation this afternoon. So it's really frustrating. 
	So our school is back, but I'm tired of hearing people say things are back because I think it's back in such a way that's so terrible that for some kids, especially ones with... The way that they're setup, it's not back for her. I feel like even for the best students in that school, it's not a great situation, not when you compare it to what my other daughter has here in Connecticut. It's really disappointing in my opinion. 
	I obviously have a lot of opinions on this. I'm on our school leadership team too and I'm a very vocal member of it, so... Yeah. I don't know, it's been frustrating. ",

In terms of challenges in returning to school, what do you expect in the future your children will struggle with in terms of being back in the classroom full-time?",3,"I know for me, my biggest concern is I've seen his ADHD spike, I guess, since he's been home. Maybe it's always been there, it's just that I have my eye on it now. He's in front of me so I could really tell that it's escalating or whatever, and I'm just really nervous that when he goes back into the classroom they won't be able to control him or they won't be able to teach him. I just think he's going to be out of hand. He's going to be off schedule. Just not used to being regimented in any way, and I think it's a ... I'm nervous about him going back, I'll put it like that.",
gaming_group,1,2,3,"Okay. In terms of challenges in returning to school, what do you expect in the future your children will struggle with in terms of being back in the classroom full-time?",2,"But to also play on that, I agree, I have a lot of the same concerns. But I also anticipate there being so many kids like that that it's just a disaster in that classroom. I feel like so many kids are going to be such hot messes with various issues, maybe ADHD, maybe they're super behind in writing now or [crosstalk 00:25:52] issues and they're struggling. I mean, I feel like so many kids have regressed and the social anxiety and there's just so many things. I just feel like how can the teachers... And that's one of the reason I'm trying to take this show over to private for my one with all the issues, is because they're so small, and those kids have been in full-time [inaudible 00:26:13] my kid that's a problem kid. But I mean, how can these teachers deal with this? Especially some of the schools that are really big with only one teacher that don't even have TAs and that sort of help. My kid's always been in an ICT classroom with two teachers, but in general those classes have been very big. There are still usually at least 27 kids and half of them have an IEP, and I would imagine that if my kid with her IEP is struggling, she's probably not the only one. So I would think that it's going to be a bit of a disaster. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe that's just the pessimist in me.  ",

It's the same time from last year, but we were desperate to save the day and try to make some happiness out of something terrible and we bought her a Nintendo Switch, which has been great and terrible at the exact same time. She has been able to foster really good relationships with friends that she already knew and deepen those relationships. 
	There was a friend of mine that... I was in a moms group, and she was like six months old, and that kid somehow found... The mom said, ""I have a kid your age, please can we connect them on Animal Crossing?"" And they played Animal Crossing, they became really good friends. And then she played this other game called BlockStar with another friend of hers from Hebrew school. And since she went back to school she's been best friends with another kid in her class and they play Fortnight and a bunch of other games. 
	So she wasn't really playing many video games. She played solitary video games, she would play by herself, but now she plays with other people. The thing is now she wants to do it all the time. She doesn't really want to do other stuff.  ",

	I haven't used the Roblox as an incentive, but I feel like that's a good idea. I know we're supposed to be trying to steer away from it but I actually like that idea. But I have started doing this where they get iPad privileges. So if you finish your homework, if you cleanup, if you whatever it is, put your plate in the sink after you eat, all of that will give you iPad privileges. And your privileges will get taken away if you are fighting with your brother or whatever it is. I've had to put that in place. 
	I've tried to do the time restraint thing, but if I don't set a timer I will forget and then they'll be on for five hours because I'm on my own, doing my own thing.

I can't believe how much she's been able to learn about Minecraft. It's amazing. There are skills involved in this. It's not entirely useless. It's just, how do we capitalize on the good and mitigate the bad? And I think that that's really hard. I mean, I just wish that my kid would be as interested in doing her homework to the extent that she's interested in... I don't know. I can't believe what she's acquired in Animal Crossing. She's not even interested in it anymore, but her island got three or four stars or whatever. There's merit to it, I guess, is where I'm coming from.

It's pretty similar to what you guys are saying. My son is the oldest, he's 12, so he didn't really use technology much in school. He's ADHD, as well as dyslexic. So purposefully, they avoided technology just for the process of writing is better. So he did use some apps for reading, like Learning Ally for reading and stuff. But basically, one positive thing is he's definitely learned how to type, which is amazing. At first I would watch him. It was so tedious. It was painful. For him, some parts would have been positive, like learning to type, it actually helped him be a little more organized because all of his work was in Google Classroom instead of forgetting papers at school. And so, he would get a notification from his teacher that he had work to do, and it would be right there.
	It wasn't something that he'd written and forgotten about or whatever. So in a lot of ways, it sort of helped him be a little more accountable because it was just in his face. I could look at it and see and help him. I don't know if he says he didn't have something, I could see that he did and it wasn't just something that he forgot he had, right? The negatives are definitely what you're saying, as far as being distracted and like... It was hopeless. I tried so hard in the beginning to keep him off of video games. But for him, it was a total distraction, but somehow he was able to manage to keep up with schoolwork. I don't know how he did it, but he definitely did his schoolwork, in addition to watching videos while the teacher was talking, which makes no sense.
	It would drive me batty, but the same thing. I'm trying to work and I can't stay on top of him. I tried all the screen time things, but then he would just find ways around it. The greatest one was figuring out that he had to have Google Docs. So he figured out how he could import his YouTube videos into Google Doc and watch them, even though I turned off YouTube. One day, I'm like, ""How is he watching that?"" And he even told me, he was like, ""Oh!"" Like he was so proud, but I was like, ""That's great that you figured it out, but it's-"" [crosstalk 00:25:52]",
gaming_group,1,3,1,"Okay. So by show of hands, who circled the positive group as having the bigger overall impact over the course of the pandemic? Parent 4, no? Okay. So did all three of you circle the negative group as having the bigger overall effect? Okay. So let's get into that a little bit. So I guess the first question that we can discuss is... Let's talk a little bit about how did your children use technology before the pandemic? Did you think that technology was a problem? Did you have concerns or problems with their use of technology for educational purposes before the pandemic and their usage? So whoever wants to speak first can go ahead.",2,"I mean, I think previous to this, he leaned towards being really hyper-focused on video games. But it was a little more manageable because we could draw the line. He didn't need the computer or the iPad to do something, so we could take it away. But like you're saying, the school, it's how he socialized, how he did all of his schoolwork. So it was a little hard to sort of... But part of me realizes it's his personality. So, in general, it's something that we have to work on anyway because there's always going to be the temptation of electronic. I mean, as adults, we still have to learn how to turn off all the other distractions and do our work, so.",

So in a lot of ways, they changed some of their strategies to make things a little more interactive instead of a little less, sort of cut and dry, so they can engage them more, which helped somewhat, but.
	Anyways, so my daughter, I don't know, she's totally addicted to her device, which she didn't... Well, we had a family iPad before, but then once this happened, she's 10, almost 11. So we eventually... She has her own device so that she could do the school stuff and she's addicted to it. But it's been a little tricky for her because she's definitely become... It's hard to motivate her to do other things because it's like... So the gratification is there. It's so easy. I don't know. I feel like that's the hardest part is how do you scale back, isn't it?",
gaming_group,1,3,2,"Yeah, that's actually going to be my next question. It's just about returning back and different challenges that we're anticipating. But I just want to check in with Parent 3. Any progress? Are you able to speak now for a minute? Or is your audio able to be turned on? Okay, so we'll move on, but if you figure out your audio, please speak up at any point.
	So, okay. So moving on to the next question, which is, as we have already started going back to school or planning to return to school, what challenges do you anticipate for your children returning to school? And are there any parts that you would maybe want to see continue or things that you would definitely want to see disappear? So anyone can take that one first.",1,"Well, since I'm already muting, I think that going forward, it's never, it's not going to ever be the same the way it was. We're in for the whole new life, basically. And I think that I'm not ever going to get my iPad back. That's gone, so that's a bummer. And I think that I'm going to see what I saw at the very end of the year when they went back. And I think I'm going to see that in the fall, meaning towards the end of the year, my son was failing out of school. And it was because I don't think anybody was monitoring him. At least when he was home, I was monitoring him a little bit. Enough to be like, ""Did you do this? Did you do that?""
	Well, I'm not a helicopter parent anyway, but I'm certainly not... I'm thinking that he's got special ed teachers who keep him on track and make them write down what he needs to do at the end of every day. But I found out that he was missing entire homeworks, entire reports, and when I would ask him, he would, ""Oh yeah, no, I turned everything in. Everything's totally fine."" And then I get an email from the school saying, ""He's got an F,"" Or ""He's got a D."" He's missing these six things. And so I anticipate it's going to be very similar to that.
	As Parent 2 mentioned with the dyslexia, my son also has dyslexia. He was just diagnosed, though. And it's not the one where you flip the things. It's a much more weird. I don't know. Anyways, he's doing the Wilson book programs. And so, and he has summer school because of it, because and he's only on grade three, it's really bad. And so, I mean, the guy can barely read, and even when he reads, he can't comprehend. So I just feel like I'm already starting off with just a huge catch-up that is unrealistic. He's not going to catch up. And so it's going to take years to get there. And it's going to take a lot of summer school, so.
	I mean, and I think that I actually anticipate that he's going to need outside help and not just tutors, but people who are specifically trained in where he has deficiencies, with the ADHD and the focusing and the reading comprehension, and really, because he has to unlearn the way he learned and then relearn it a different way with the Wilson, that I think that I'm just anticipating a shit show",

And not just, he's going to get extra support through sports through the school, for sure, because I make sure it's in his IEP. I fight for him, like nobody's business.

So I don't know, I think that there were some good things, like with the Google classroom and stuff, I could, not that I did, but because he gets very upset if I try to stay on top of him. He was able to see what he was missing and everything. And so I think going back, I think that he has learned some executive skills that he didn't have before, which is really good for somebody who's 16 and theoretically will fly the coop in two years. I do think he has expressed the fact that he is looking forward to going back to school. Because he will not be allowed to play video games while he's supposed to be listening to the teachers, so that's a good thing. I do agree that he has not learned as much as he should have. And I think that the thing that I'm most worried about is his math because he's supposed to go into pre-calculus next year, and I'm not sure he knows trigonometry or whatever he was supposed to learn this year. But we'll deal with it, tutors, whatever if he gets into trouble.
	I'm not sure that I would agree with leaving everybody back because I do think... For my daughter, she's much more high functioning than my son. And she had a 99 average between her classes and went to school and got all her schoolwork done and never handed anything in late. And meanwhile, my son had 20 missing assignments the day before school ended, and somehow he got it down to six. So, I think my daughter, I think she actually benefited because she's a seventh-grade girl and seventh-grade girls are so mean to each other and the fact that they were at home and did not have to interact with all the other mean girls. I think that was actually good for her. So-",

I mean, my son was, I guess, I don't know how much, whatever's on, confidential. But the day before COVID hit, he was suspended for substance abuse in the school. And then he didn't have to do his suspension. Because they were like, ""No, don't come in."" Because I'm a health care worker, and they're like, ""No, no, she's been exposed to COVID."" So COVID was amazing because he was not allowed to interact with anybody for the first six months. And so he sort of was forced to deal with the substance abuse stuff and didn't have access to it and all that, so that [crosstalk 00:37:34] was good. And now, I'm really worried about him going back because all those things are going to be there again. The social pressures and all that stuff.",
gaming_group,1,3,3,"Yeah, I was. And this is a question for everybody. We've heard a lot of parents talk about the pros and cons of the ways in which their children's teachers have managed their kid's specific needs, how Google classroom plays a role. How discord, how these other online resources affect that. So I just wanted to know, from you guys' perspective, how your specific teachers have either contributed or aided in the problems that your kids have dealt with throughout the pandemic and online technology in-school use and things like that.",2,"One thing I would say sort of to add to both of these things is my daughter's 10, and she's in fifth grade. So one negative thing that I saw that her teacher actually helped with a little was I think it was a lot for them to have to stare at themselves on the screen all the time. My daughter started, I don't know, worrying about things about herself, like ""My eyebrows are too... You can't see my..."", all these crazy things. And it's because she's looking at all of her friends and herself straight on all the time. So it did become sort of a conversation with her teacher. And they were pretty strict at first about trying to get them to turn all their cameras on.
	But I think they became a little more lenient when they sort of realized that kids can have their camera off but still be paying attention, which is the case with my daughter, probably not my son. But my daughter definitely, she would be doing what she needed to do most of the time. But so I do think it kind of, I don't know, it was this weird... She became a little more self-conscious, I think, I don't know.
	But then it was interesting also to see the difference between my daughter's teachers and my son's teachers. He had way more daily, all the time classes in-person on Zoom. Whereas my daughter was a little more... She did have in-person, but it was, I don't know, half the amount of time as him probably. So I don't know. She had to work more independently than he did. I don't know.",

So I just wanted to know, from you guys' perspective, how your specific teachers have either contributed or aided in the problems that your kids have dealt with throughout the pandemic and online technology in-school use and things like that.",1,"I'll go. So I think that the teachers... It really depended on the type of teacher. The general ed teachers, I found, were less tolerant of any adjustments to the technology or to the timeframes of things. And they were just less flexible. And I think it's because they were just overwhelmed with so many kids, plus so many kids with technology issues. And my boys didn't have the same experience because I don't have a girl. But I really, if I had been her, I would have been like, ""Oh my God, oh my God."" I would have been like, ""Whoa, this is not good. Everybody's seeing me."" I would have flipped, so. But my kids are like, ""I have to shower, what?"" So I think that the general ed teachers were... I found some of them to be mean and just intolerant to any adjustments.
	And, but then the special ed teachers would come in and say, ""Okay, let's deal with this."" And much the way they do at the actual school in-person. And so, I felt that they really helped facilitate the situation. And also act as a go-between in between me, the general ed teacher, and [inaudible 00:42:49] and my kids, both of them really. And so, I think that because they had two teachers, that really helped a lot. But also, I would find they would just disappear. We would log into school, and they would be like, ""So-and-so is out."" Okay. And they would be out for one day. ""So here's an assignment. We're not going to give you any instructions."" Or ""We don't have a teacher for you because we don't have subs. So go do it.""
	And that was very hard for them to understand that. And then you had also the ones who were like, ""Well, I'm out for whatever,"" or ""I'm sick."" A lot of them did get sick, so they were out for a month. And so, in that case, if they had two teachers, the other one picked up the slack. But it was mostly just one day here, one day there, where it wasn't anticipated. And so the kids were just sort of left hanging. And it was tough because they were like, ""Well, how do we do attendance if she's not there? Or he's not there?"" And it was just, Anyway, I think the teachers were frustrated, and that showed, that came through very much so. And honestly, they should have been frustrated. It was frustrating for everybody. So, that's it.",

So, there was definitely a wide range of responses. Some teachers handled things really well. And I have to say that at my son's school, they were very lenient about handing in assignments late. And my daughter's school. They were also trying to focus on sort of the kids who were not handing in assignments, which I thought was really nice of them.
	So, but there were definitely, there were some teachers who showed up every day and wanted the cameras on. I mean, I guess they all showed up every day, but there was definitely some people who allowed the kids... Like Parent 4, Child 1 would, sorry, my son would lay in bed for his first, for the morning of classes. And some of the teachers were like, ""Fine. He's in bed."" But some of the teachers were like, ""No, he has to sit up, and we have to see him sit up."" Because he would fall back to sleep during some of the classes, so. But I think the teachers were all... But my kids go to these really progressive schools in the city. So I think that that had something to do with the fact that the teachers were very lenient and forgiving of all the craziness that was happening.",
gaming_group,1,3,4,"Yeah. The school can make a big difference. Okay. So, Parent 2, I think we did want to hear from you a little bit. Do you have anything to say about any challenges you're anticipating in going back and returning to being fully in-person?",2,"I think as far as challenges, I think it's more social. Right now, it's hard to get my kids to... I don't know. They feel like they've become hermits in some ways. So it is hard for me to get them to think outside of their video game box. You could give them a list of things to do and they can't. I don't know, they don't seem to want to do anything, so I think that's going to be the challenge. I mean, just really social, I think.",

Do you have anything to say about any challenges you're anticipating in going back and returning to being fully in-person?",1,"I'll go. I think, first of all, we need to remember that it's not the '80s, and we're in a totally different era with or without COVID. I think that they are online all the time. And talk to adults who are young, much younger than us, but still in their 20s and things. And that's how they live. They're constantly online, be it for work and for gaming. And in some cases, I think that's just going to be the new norm, and it's not all bad because some gaming will teach you strategy and it's conflict resolution and all sorts of things. I mean, you can go one way or the other. In terms of the gaming, though. I think that I'm seeing that my youngest, my eight-year-old is much more addicted than he ever was.
	Before. Yes, he had my iPad. Yes, but I could easily take it away from him. Now, it's almost like the Chromebooks became a gateway drug to this whole, like a video game addiction thing. And both of my kids are complete addicts, complete. If I take it away from them, they will go through absolute withdrawals, to the point where I'm like, ""Whoa, this is not an appropriate reaction to what's going on."" And the world is ending apparently, if I turn off the internet, so. And so I think that because it's sort of the Chromebooks came in and they figured out how to use them, and the teachers taught them how to use them. Now they've got all these skills that they can use for good or evil. And so they're using it for both.
	And I do find my eight-year-old, who would never lie and sneak, sneaks the iPad, sneaks the video games. He still admits to it, but soon, he will not admit to it. And he will not say, ""Oh mom, last night I woke up, and I played the video."" At some point, he's going to start lying. My other one is I actually have to cut him off at the knees. I have to say, ""Everything's being shut down in 10 minutes."" Otherwise, he will be up until 3:00 AM, every single night playing, playing, playing. And so are all of his friends. That's what I don't understand. I'm like, ""Who are you playing with?"" And he's like, ""All of my friends."" And so they're all. I don't know what's going on, but everybody is just constantly on video games.
	And that's how they interact socially. And we're not into play dates yet anymore, or them getting together socially outside yet. Maybe it's because everybody tends to have younger kids. So they don't want to expose those who are vaccinated. I mean, those who are not vaccinated to anything, which I totally get. And so they still need that for socialization. So I'm stuck, I'm stuck between both. And I think it's just going to get worse, and I think we just need to embrace it and try and figure out what they're really getting out of it in a positive way and emphasize that.
	And so, and I think there are a lot... I can't think of all of them now, but I read an article that was just really, it was pro-gaming, and it was awesome. Because I was like, ""Oh, I never thought of that."" The strategy and conflict resolution. And they had brothers who lived... Were really close, and then they moved far away from each other. But the one thing they had in common was video games, and they talk every day. That's a good thing. And so I think there's a lot of positives that people forget about. On the flip side, they need to be-",

Do you have anything to say about any challenges you're anticipating in going back and returning to being fully in-person?",1,"On the flip side, they need to be able to control it. And it's hard. It's almost like... It's not like drugs, cigarettes, or something like that, it's like sugar or caffeine. You can't avoid sugar. You have to have a little bit of it, but you got to be able to control it. So, we could look at it like, sugar can be a good thing, sometimes it makes things taste good, but there has to be a balance and a way of figuring that out. And so, I would love help from the school and from Child Mind Institute.",

Do you have anything to say about any challenges you're anticipating in going back and returning to being fully in-person?",2,"We've had a lot of the same thing, but a few things. I sort of have a specific time, like the internet goes off. That way, it takes me out of it. Like they know, and then, I mean, they will ask for me to turn it back on or whatever, but it's like, I don't know. Because if it were up to me, I would forget, and it would be much later. So, that kind of helps a lot. The thing with my kids are, the different things they're doing, lots of things are positive, Minecraft, all those things, but the most annoying thing are the YouTube videos of craziness that just keep going and going. It's just such a mind numbing time-suck that my daughter gets into. I mean, so it really depends on what they're doing, but it's also difficult to always know what they're doing, because they know how to get around everything.",

So, their circle is bigger and more connected through these. So, it's really, really sweet to my daughter. Now, her cousin knows her best friend and it's not just this person that exists. So, that's good, but it's definitely trying to do it in moderation and to be able take a break and do other things and be engaged in the conversation around you and not need it every second. Every break in the day doesn't have to be video games, but I don't know, it's a battle."

So, yeah, he's had a problem with it for a while. I think one thing that I actually wanted to say that I didn't bring up before about the social thing, my son actually had a girlfriend all from COVID. So, they've been together for the past 17 months or something. And for a while, they were like their own pod, and he went to her lake house and she would spend time with us. And now that things are opening up, he wants to spend time with his friends and she wants to spend time with her friends. And so, they're having these issues that they haven't had for the past 17 months with things that girlfriends and boyfriends probably should have learned how to navigate by this point in their relationship. So, I know that has nothing to do with video gaming, but I wanted to say it before, but I forgot.",

And it's called, he has learned so much and he can regurgitate it on the fly, because it's called over-simplified. And it's these little tiny clips of just oversimplified history, oversimplified explanations about things. And he introduced it to us. He's eight years old. My 13 year old and I both like it and I learn stuff from it. I'm like, ""Wow, I'm a history major, no, I remember that"".

I mean, I trusted the school. I knew that they had computer class, and I do think that's important, but I left it up to them. And for me, we used it almost exclusively for entertainment. Like when I needed to get something done, like make dinner, or something, and I just needed them occupied, that was it.
	I mean, some of that context, I think, matters, because I'm a single parent and we lived in an apartment in Brooklyn. So, the option of saying, ""Go outside and play,"" isn't there. If I have to be inside doing something, they have to be inside with me. And that's changed too, because we've moved since then. I mean, very rarely I would use maybe YouTube, or something, to show them something that they asked about, that I couldn't just answer in words. But I didn't use it much for education, so...",

They knew how to use them, but it was just an arbitrary thing, because they would use them in school and it was sufficient. 
	And so, obviously, during the pandemic, they had a steep learning curve, and they went from like 10% of knowledge to 200% of knowledge. I've tried blocking some apps from them and websites, and they actually figure out a way around. So, even though it's blocked, they can still somehow manage to get around it.

I feel like that's actually been worse, because he's not able to focus as much, because he's removed from the classroom. He's currently still 100% remote. So, I think it's harder for him to relate to his peers and teachers, because they're just a face on the screen. 
	ADHD, I feel like has gotten worse, but dyslexia has gotten better. Not that it's gotten better, but he's able to manage it better, having those access to that technology. It's been sort of a trade off and, and we're still figuring out how to manage that. Because when he wants help, then he's like, it's hard to pull him away from the computer. So, he tends to be now overstimulated, dysregulated. 
	And so, we're talking about, that's great, he moved up three reading levels, but he's bouncing off the wall. So, how do you manage that? It's a trade-off, but it's still, I feel like it's been helpful for his self-esteem, to be able to keep up with the class. It's still hard for him, but at least, in the dyslexia realm, he's at least able to do things faster. And so, I think he feels better about himself.",

So, it's not even just one school, it's the computer, that's the big issue, or the tablet. 
	But he can't focus on live or asynchronous activities on the computer because of the other options available. I mean, I do think, in theory, if you had a single... Or you had some kind of computer device that the teacher controlled, that did not have any freedom for the student to change what you could look at, it could work, maybe, but it doesn't. It doesn't have that. He just clicks around and does anything except what he's supposed to be looking at. Parent 5, Child 2, I need you to leave right now, because you're making too much noise.

But he also would get up and walk away in the middle of things. He had no problem lying to me. He'd tell me, ""Oh yeah, class is done. I signed out of the meeting because it was over."" 
	In one school, they had a pair of call to try to work with him one-on-one on the phone. Which was terrible because she had a cell phone with a bad connection, so it was difficult, but he would hang up on her constantly. It was so rude, but she would call me and say, ""He hung up on me.""
	And then the second school, they did nothing, absolutely nothing to take his IEP and translate it to online. They just said, ""We can't. There's nothing we can do."" And it's been extremely frustrating. So, he's falling behind, way behind, in terms of where he was. I don't know that he's lost learning, but he hasn't been making progress. And it is, he needs to be in-person.
	Now, they returned to in-person four days a week, but they have not stopped using those computers. They sit at their desk, six feet apart, and every activity is computer-based, except recess and lunch. Surprise, those are his favorite subjects now. I mean, I think there's a tendency that they always would be. So, maybe it's not the technology part. 
	And it is a shame, because the computer, a screen can be a great learning tool. Like Parent 4 was saying, at their old school, before the pandemic, the kindergarten has had a research project, which the parents helped out with. And I was one of them. The kids were going to get a fish tank, and each kid chose a fish they wanted to research. So, that's what I did. 
	I sat next to them at the computer and said, ""What's your fish?"" And we found a picture of it together on the computer, to print it out. And then we looked up information. Then they had to find out how big is the fish. And we cut a string, and then they click it over to the fish tank to see if it would fit in their fish tank. And that was an amazing use of the computer with adult assistance. And that's not what we're getting though, at this point. So, I'll stop.",

I mean, online learning has been a disaster at the end of eighth grade, and in ninth grade now, first year in high school, because he does better with people in the presence, in the classroom, that's more motivating, it's more engaging, does the same thing, just lying. You're just constantly monitoring, trying to find out what the, ""Hey?"" Teachers acting like, ""You should be doing this. Or you should be letting them know."" And it's just a nightmare. It's a nightmare.
	Also, with burgeoning independence, he used to walk to school from our house in Brooklyn, like it's five blocks. But he'd go there and come home by himself, in eighth grade. And then this term, under the same roof with us 24/7, I mean, it's horrible. He's just started back two days and every other Friday a week. So, he's taking the subway to Astoria, to high school. So that's been helpful. But the same thing, they're in the room with their laptop. 
	Whether you're at home or you're in the school, you're being taught... There's Roomies and Zoomies, and you're all in the same class through the screen, through the screen, through the screen. So, it's problematic. It's very problematic. He is an IEP. He has ADD. He has counselors who call him up, but then they've offered other help and he just blows off this, or doesn't return any email. Or you keep trying to positively engage him and reminding him of this, that and the other. It's too much. He doesn't follow through. I think he would get a lot more help at school, and be motivated and... You know?",

So, yeah, learning at home, disaster. She went from fifth grade with one teacher for every subject, really smart kid. It was so easy. She put in the minimum, she got Bs. She did just fine. Now, terrible transition into middle school. Terrible. I mean, there's like six different teachers. She's got executive functioning. Disaster, with that.
	She's no longer organized. It's been a real challenge. We were able to... In September, they went back to school every other day. It was twice a week. And in March, we got her to start going to school every day, which has helped her get more into a routine. I have an IEP meeting set up for her on Friday, to gather extra help.
	I mean, it's still been a battle even with her back in school. She's not getting the extra attention that she needs. It just, it's been an awful transition. Maybe if your kid's just like... How do you say it? Is normal, doesn't have any extra needs, maybe it went okay. But I know for my daughter, it did not transition well.
	And I do want to say for one of my younger daughter, she's very anxious. She likes to stay close to me, always wants to know where I am, if I leave the house, where I'm going. So, being at home and doing school, she actually, she was my best one. She was not doing that great in school, but at home, she actually, she was on time for every meeting. She knew when to sign in and log in. I think she was just so much more comfortable being at home and I was there all the time. So, that was nice, see that in her. ",

And so, last semester was difficult, but in the one trimester, but the one that just finished, she actually had the grades, were the best they've ever been. 
	She doesn't have the social issues. She just, she is dyslexic. So, for her to just be focused on this computer, it actually works well for her. And, of course, what I did, because of the whole roadblocks and all the other issues, I put so many restrictions on that computer. I used a springtime from the Apple. I bought Custodio, for her phone. 
	I bought so many restrictions that if she was going to be on the computer, what she wanted to do wasn't a whole lot to do except schoolwork. So, what actually helped her in that sense. She actually did better. It makes me insane because she doesn't get out of that chair. But in terms of the ocular work, I think it worked okay for her super.

Reports to research, I'm okay with that, but anything else I feel like it's unnecessary. 
	And to speak to what Parent 5 and Parent 2 has said, my son also has ODD, and it has gotten worse as we've been home. Like I said, it's been a weird thing with dyslexia improving with some of the things he's managing, but all the other stuff is falling apart. So, if he were more attentive, I would send him to school. But he forgets, he loses his mask, puts his hand in his mouth. If he gets bored, he just starts jumping, rolling around. It's not feasible for me to send him in now, as much as I would love him to have that in-person experience.
	But yeah, I definitely agree that the computers must go, at least at home. I don't care what they do in school. They sometimes behave better in school. They're more compliant, when they come home, they want to relax. So, it's a little bit different. I would be perfectly happy to just keep it for bare, and then they can always catch up, because there's computers everywhere. So, I don't fear they'll be falling behind in their knowledge and experience.",

",5,"I absolutely want these things out of my house, especially the school issued ones that I can't institute control over. That really bugged me. I understood, in the sense that they didn't want me also messing up their machine, but if I can't keep my kid off inappropriate YouTube sites, then it's not an appropriate tool.
	However, I'm trying here to think about, how could you do it in a positive way? Because I feel obligated. Media studies is my thing. I'm not anti media studies, but I teach college students, I do not teach ignorance. There's a big difference. But I think some of the problems with the online reading programs and mass problems, for me, well, there's two things.
	One, I don't think the kids get real feedback. Yes, the game tells you if you got the question right or wrong, but I don't think it's the same effect as a person that you haven't had a relationship with, the teacher, expressing that, ""Wow, I've noticed that you've been improving."" Or, ""I noticed you're not doing as well today. Are you sleeping?"" Whatever it is, that kind of response feedback is really crucial, especially the younger they are, not just an instant little... The game fanfare and stuff is fine.
	But two is, as a parent, I have no idea what they're doing when it's online. You don't get a print here. It's not like getting the papers. And I got too much paper before this, then I would get home like, ""Oh my child wrote all these sentences."" Or, ""These are their math worksheets. I can see what they're doing, and what they're struggling with. I can see their handwriting improving."" I can't see anything. And the teachers on the report cards, they don't say much. Just, it's like, ""Meet standards. Approaching standards."" But what does that mean? I can't see the material. 
	I mean, unless I don't work and sit next to them all day and watch them doing it, which is incredibly boring on top of everything, on top of just not being possible. So, in theory, if there were some programs or a way of using that involved, both things, like some practice of the math online, but also some way of a parent viewing results quickly, like getting, I don't know, a weekly snapshot of like, ""What did your child do? How many problems did they miss? Does it look like they're walking away maybe because they're not doing any of it?"" I mean, different way to get contact.",

	But it's a problem also, you have to carry your laptop into school. I just wonder, in New York City, so everyone knows that every kid out on the street has a laptop in their backpack. I'm just waiting for... Not to mention their phone. But it's been positive for him, even going in and having the onscreen class, because he's getting to know the building. It's a new high school, I mean, for him, and he has met some kids. So, just finding his way around the building is the thing, and meeting kids in the flesh. So, it's been a plus.",
gaming_group,1,4,4,"It sounds like it would be helpful to have some tangible feedback of progress, so you're missing that. And then also maybe doing things through technology is just, people are giving more limited feedback and you're missing that personalized touch.
	I have one more question about the education piece, and then I want to just move in more into the gaming. Because I know I'm hearing a lot that gaming has been an issue for a bunch of you.

So, every other day she had to be at the school, at 7:15, but on her home days, there was no live instruction. So, she could sleep till whenever. And she's getting to the point, like on the weekends, she loves to sleep later. She's going to bed the same time, I'd let her sleep in. That was hard. It's hard. It's been hard to get her up every day, to be on a schedule. But other than that, I'm very happy that they're back. Sorry.",

	I have one more question about the education piece, and then I want to just move in more into the gaming. Because I know I'm hearing a lot that gaming has been an issue for a bunch of you. 
	I know some of your kids are already back in school, but what challenges have you seen for returning to in-person school, or what challenges do you anticipate in returning to in-person school after whatever amount of time?",3,"I foresee that being an issue as well. Because, right now, they can wake up five minutes before their class. They can brush their teeth in between breaks, or between classes rather. Like they can eat in front of the screen. They don't have to worry so much about their outfit, and being comfortable. They can lay in bed when they're in class, it's fine.
	Once they start school, they can't do any of that. And my oldest actually expressed that to me. She said, ""I'm concerned."" Because she started sixth grade this year, and it's a new group of kids. So, she will not know anyone when she goes in for seventh grade in school, because we started talking about it. I said, ""Well, most likely you'll be going in, because you guys can't stay remote forever.""
	And she, herself expressed that, she said, ""I don't know if I would feel comfortable with the schedule, with the noise again, and people I don't know."" So, I foresee that being an issue. And the schedule, they'd have to get up earlier. They can't just leave the class because they're bored, or walk around with their laptop into a different room because they want to get comfortable. They got to sit at their desk all the time. It's a lot more rigid, there's limitations with that.
	But on the other hand, I think having that schedule and having that set routine will be helpful. It's just, I foresee the adjustment period being difficult. And from my youngest, he actually had a lot of anxiety going to school, because of all the issues he was having. He found school being completely overwhelming, and the noise, and the concentration, and the duration of classes was really horrible for him. We would deal with crying spells and meltdowns every single morning. 
	I'm not looking forward to that, and I anticipate that happening. But at the same time, being ADHD and ODD, being remote is not working for him. So, obviously, he would have to go back to school. Again, I may need some hardcore liquor just to get me through those mornings, because that used to be grueling for us every single morning. 
	So, for us, parting with the comfort and the informality, but at the same time, looking forward to in-person interactions, social interactions, because that's getting shunted right now. I feel like they're missing out on that and their development is sliding backwards. Because on the screen friends are not the same as in real life friends. ",
gaming_group,1,4,5,"	I'd like to hear from you a little bit about what was your kids' exposure or experience with gaming before the pandemic? Did you have concerns before the pandemic? Were there benefits before the pandemic? And how has that changed? And what are your concerns, or do you see benefits with gaming? Parent 4, you want to lead us off, because...",4,"Sure. Sure. Yeah. Well, for Parent 4, Child 2, of course, as I said, the seven-year-old, she just wasn't allowed to do it, so it didn't change. And right now, I don't think she really has the time or facilities to get involved in it, because I won't let her when I'm around, and then in school, people are monitoring. So, it's not an issue for her.
	For Parent 4, Child 1, she had started doing that, playing the games and all, but it was just because she didn't have full access to a computer all the time, except just when she was doing homework. It was just, ""Here's your time. Now your time's over. Now you're done."" I didn't really mind. I would have preferred it was something other than computer game, but if that's what she wanted to do, I didn't really have an issue with that. 
	But it's just that, now, it just seems like it's always available. And even, sometimes with certain restrictions, she could find a way around it. Instead of using Safari, which was restricted by the computer, she found a way to use Chrome, and I had to work around that. I called Apple and spent hours on the phone to try to figure out how to block that too. And so, it became a real struggle. 
	I think we've got it under control, but it just does seem that it's just much more focus on the screen. For us, I don't think it's so much that gaming has taken over, because I do have restrictions, but it's just the focus on the computer. And certainly in the time she has, she would go to that. And it's definitely become a social aspect at this point.
	It's like, ""Oh, can I have a come over?"" And then they want to sit and play computer games together. So, ""Dude, you just spent all day on the computer, you could have done that at a come over? She's finally in front of you and you're going to sit in front of the computer together?"" It's just crazy to me. So...",

Parent 4, you want to lead us off, because...",4,"No. No. She's focused so much on just making friends with people she knows in the game. And she's mentioned a couple other people, but I have always made it real... We've been very strong for the fact that, ""I don't want you be with people you don't know."" And as far as I know, she's been respectful of that. Maybe she doesn't let me know, but I think that she's pretty respectful of that. And it's, for her, it's more fun if there are people she already knows. She already has a relationship with them, so that makes it more interpersonal, somehow.",

Were there benefits before the pandemic? And how has that changed? And what are your concerns, or do you see benefits with gaming? Parent 4, you want to lead us off, because...",5,"It took me a minute to remember before. Well, I mean, one reason is, one of the things I study, and I'm teaching a class on video games now, it's complicated in my house because I am a video gamer. And I knew that, going, before I had kids, that this would be part of our lives. It doesn't mean that they can play whenever and whatever they want. 
	My kids played some games before the pandemic. I had a lot of control though, because they were not, at that point, technologically able to turn on or unlock any real game by themselves, completely by themselves. They could ask for it and I could give it to them or not. I think that they did have more TV access, typical stuff, but not so much with video games, but they did play. I liked that, but then again, I was curating the game, so I was comfortable with that.
	Now, it is, I think I'm still maintaining better control over games than just YouTube access. For me, YouTube is the thing that is everywhere and you can't block it out well enough. Also, it's just, an eight year old shouldn't be watching, 20 year olds, to eight hours a day, just, even if they're not swearing, or something. It's just things that he's learning, that he shouldn't be learning yet. 
	But he does come home, and that's what all he wants. He wants to play Minecraft, Minecraft, Minecraft. It's not a bad game, but he doesn't have any control. I can't set an hour long limit for him that he would respect. Like I said, I do set limits, but I have to be active in a way that's hard when I'm working full-time, and not getting... We're not out of the house enough, still, I guess, to make it easier, because he can't think of anything else to do. That's the real problem.
	If I take it away, I have to take it away for like a whole weekend and he'll start remembering, ""Oh yeah, I can think of, we can come up with these other games."" But as soon as they get a day of playing games, like I sleep in and they manage to turn it on, then it's just moping and, ""I can't play. I can't think of anything. I'm bored."" I guess it's a skill that they're going to have to learn though. The ability to respect limits, but also recognize, make choices.
	""I have this much gaming time, and I'm going to actively choose what I want to play."" He'll do something like, ""But I didn't get to do this thing I wanted to do."" I was like, ""Well, you should have done it before your time right now."" I don't know when an eight year old with ADHD is really going to develop that. I definitely had to give in for a while, when they were home all the time. I had to give into it just to get my work done. And that's what I didn't like about the pandemic stuff.",

I mean, we weren't seeing anyone also, right? This was the only way they could communicate with their friends. I mean, they had each other, but then that was always going to be okay for a little bit, but then they get in fights, and they need their space. Yeah, I'm trying to have the house quiet so I can be on a call, and that would be the only thing I could do for them to not bother me while I'm trying to work.",

But then it became like, ""Oh my God, I got to keep them busy when school wasn't keeping them busy."" Because they just had to do it on their own, and they're too young to really... I was the teacher, and working, and trying to do my job and keep them happy. And not enough time and energy for all of that to work.",

Were there benefits before the pandemic? And how has that changed? And what are your concerns, or do you see benefits with gaming? Parent 4, you want to lead us off, because...",3,"One of my main concerns is, as mentioned before, by many of us, kids having access to games and being able to talk to people in the game, I don't know who these people are. They may not be who they say they are. And I've tried to talk to my kids about stranger danger and online safety. 
	But again, when they feel like they've connected with someone, it's hard for them to not... They could give away certain information without meaning to, or realizing to. And so, then they open themselves up and, potentially, the family up for whatever dangs there are. 
	I remember I have to constantly remind them, like, ""If someone's asking you how old you are, if you're a boy or a girl, it doesn't matter. You joke around with them, you don't have to be rude. You could say, 'I'm a dog, and I'm seven in dog years, or something.' Like, 'Well, I'm 40 in dog years.' Make it a joke. Say, 'I'm an alien. I'm a monster.' So they think that you're just goofing around.'''""
	I want them to understand that people may not what they are, but they have this image in their head, of who they're playing with. And it's hard, because we're talking about seven year olds and 60 year olds playing in the same platform. They're all different frames of mind, and different psychological stability, you know? So, I have that concern.
	It's been hard for me to explain it to the younger one. The older one seems to get it, but even so, there's still issues. That's been the biggest thing for me with the games. Aside all the horrible things, in terms of addiction, isolation, ignoring me when I ask for something, and having tantrums when I take it away, but the safety. And understanding that you have to keep in mind that you don't know who's on the other end. ",

So far, everything needed me to okay it. It would be great if they could play with their friends, and they let them play one game like that, which was among us.
	Because the chat time was so short that... It wasn't as bad as some of the others. But there are still problematic things that happened, because I played it, like friends that play, it is adults and children.
	And I tried to talk to them about the same thing. About, ""You shouldn't ever give out your age."" And like, ""But why?"" ""It doesn't matter."" I was like, ""Well, because sometimes people can use that information to locate children and kidnap them."" Was like, ""I wouldn't go with them."" 
	And I'm just like, ""Just stop giving away information about yourself."" That's one area I'm very hesitant to give them access to, but the pressure is mounting as more of their friends are doing it. And it is a social... I like the social part if it's all eight year olds, or something, but the mixed group thing was very difficult. ",
gaming_group,1,4,6,"Right. I guess last question... I feel like I know the answer to this, based on some of the things you said. And so, thinking about the changes that have happened in gaming use, is there anything with gaming that you would like to see continue as we return back to school? What do you hope for about gaming, as we go back?",3,"I mean, there's also positive things. Granted, I hate the darn thing. It's driving me mad. And yes, they are in it way too much. But it forced my son to start doing math, because when he's in Minecraft and he has to calculate his resources, even though he says he hates math, somehow, he's able to quickly pick up on how many more resources he needs, what he has, and how much of it he needs. It just becomes second nature to him.
	And I tried to explain to him before, when he said, ""I hate math. It's useless."" I said, ""But you use math in Minecraft."" He says, ""No, but that doesn't count, because that's fun."" You know? It has its positive aspect. Also, my husband is a gamer, and this gives them an opportunity to bond, and they can play the games together. Also, on the days when they can see their friends, they could play the games together among us. When they do a private game and they'll do it together, that's fine.
	If there could be some way to ensure that we're not having such different range of ages play, and we could ensure, in some way, the safety of them playing on, and maybe have more control in limitations, in terms of how much time they can spend on there, I don't mind it. Because, like I said, it has some uses. It forced him to read, also, because he has to read the instructions, you know? Whereas before, he would just walk away. It does, but if it's uncontrolled, unmonitored, it's just free for all, and definitely, yeah. That's my five cents out there.",

Just, I don't know why that one game, but my kids have a same-age cousin, who, they've always lived on opposite sides of the country. So they've met her a few times, but they've actually formed a closer relationship with her than they ever did before. 
	Because my brother and I were just more motivated, because they weren't each seeing their separate friends, so we connected them on the phone so they could talk and play this game together at the same time. But yeah, that was in a private room with, with, I'm trying to keep an eye on who else is joining. And these games, if all on the developers' side, they absolutely could make it safer.
	First of all, as long as it's definitely not made with kids in mind, and YouTube made YouTube Kids, but you can't block out... I don't know. Maybe there needs to be more pressure. I just feel like YouTube shouldn't be something that you can't say, ""Look, I don't want it on this computer."" You can't block it, because if you block it on Safari, you can get to it through-",

Because, to pry him away from the screen, when that's been his lifeblood over more than a year, it's going to be very hard to get him biking, and hanging out with friends, and whatever. I think it's going to be hard.
	Just because they do talk over games with his specific friends, it's going to be step-by-step and two steps backwards, several times. I mean, you really have to gird yourself for... When you want to just burst free into this other thing, it doesn't work that way. Usually, you got to keep these incremental little things. That's frustrating. ",
