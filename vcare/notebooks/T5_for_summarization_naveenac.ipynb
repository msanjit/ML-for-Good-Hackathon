I don't know if that's the right word, into Docs, but it wasn't a huge amount. It wasn't doing research, it wasn't hours and hours. My elementary school guy, he didn't have any homework on the computer at all. And my middle schooler had very little, like type this one thing or something like that. It was very little on the computer. And for myself, in terms of my family, I lock the video games so that there was very little access to video games during the week.\"\n",

My kids didn't even know how to use the features on our TV, the smart features, they didn't know they could access YouTube on it or anything like that. So it was very controlled and very little. I also had my children in a lot of afterschool activities. My older son was in an orchestra, he also was in a band, theater groups, there was a lot of afterschool activity. A lot of playing outside, a lot of going to the park and all that stuff. Yeah, so...\"\n",

Not all of it because she was assigned in school, but she definitely was on doing homework, I feel like, a good amount. Nothing like now, but definitely was using it. My middle schooler also, but not as much. They both did play games or use Instagram, my daughter was really into Instagram, not as much anymore but definitely games. Now it's just like a free-for-all. I mean, they're in their rooms with the door shut, I have no idea what they're doing all day. I just know that they're doing their homework, getting good grades. I think they're on electronics the entire day.\"\n",

Maybe once a week he would type, words of the week was one of the options I picked to do. That was his only interaction with computer. Of course he had devices to play on, and he would go to his father's house every other weekend and he would be more exposed there to computers. But still he was busy. He was busy during the week, there was school, there was getting to school, getting from school, that's a trip in itself.\"\n",

And of course we were able to control it, it was an item you had to earn and if you didn't do well then you don't get to play. So it was a tool we could use as incentive during the week. So now that's all out the window, it's all available right there all day long. And getting him away from the computer now is a project in itself every day.\"\n",

So at first it seemed like a good thing, and I'm sure it is a good thing, it's just, like I said, it's just become overwhelming use of technology because they sit in front of it all day. And another thing, this use of YouTube, because I understand teachers post some things that you can look up on YouTube, so you can't block YouTube because it'll be used as a tool for one of those classes they have.\"\n",

And transition from looking at your Google classroom or your Google meet and here's YouTube, it's just so easy. And we were not always there, we still have jobs and other things to do, can't just sit on top of them. So this accessibility of technology that has this type of content, like YouTube, that's not beneficial for kids, that's been problematic, to say the least.\"\n",
    "Parent 5: \"So for us, we only had a desktop and a laptop, which was more than sufficient pre-pandemic. And then everybody needed a device, all of a sudden everybody needed a device Needed to be on at basically the same times so we got one device from school, we bought a laptop, we found an old laptop. It was like the gathering of devices. And then teaching... My nine-year-old, teaching him how to use it, he really hadn't used computers in that way. And so teaching him how to use it. My middle son is prone to migraines and so being on the screen caused migraines and so that caused some aversion because he didn't want to be on.\"\n",
    "Parent 5: \"The schedules were kind of crazy, like all over the place. And the truth is that it's hard because my 17-year-old, who knew how to do all these things just kind of stayed in his room for months. And it was just... I feel bad saying it, but he was kind of left to his own devices. He wasn't a big social media guy, he has no social media still, but when the only way to communicate with his peers became to use... What is it? Discord, and all these other things, that became the only way to communicate with people. And then it almost, I feel like... Like Parent 1 said, it's like this black hole that sucks you in.\"\n",
    "Parent 5: \"And then there was also no schedule. Because we have some special needs in our family, my schedule is really tight with my kids and so the little guys we go to bed at 8:30 and then 9:00 and then the older one was in bed by 10:00 and there was a lot of structure, and literally it was like a bomb hit it. People were going to bed at 1:00 in the morning, it was just totally... It felt chaotic and out of control, and it felt like the technology sputtered for a little bit as we gt devices figured out how to get everybody on and then it was this black hole that sucked you in. And then everybody was on for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours, and it felt out of control.\"\n",
    "Parent 3: \"Sure, when lock down happened my then first grader, the school did a great job pivoting to remote quite quickly. They used seesaw as a platform. I did get two laptops from the DOE because we have a lot of tech but it's all very old and kind of fragile and I'm like, they're going to wreck it all. Nothings insured. We're self-employed and I could just see the whole business being wiped out so we did take a DOE iPads which was a lifesaver. But also, again, we got to one point where the computer teacher did that YouTube... We were not on the YouTube and she sent one link and they figured out, \"Oh, I can get to YouTube from this link.\"\"\n",
    "Parent 3: \"And then it was like a bomb went off, they figured it out, they figured out workarounds and it was like Pandora's box. I was trying to figure out how to block... I was on the phone with the DOE, I was on the phone with a parent coordinator, I was calling the principal, like, \"How can I block YouTube without...\" I was putting timer things, it was driving me crazy, and it was downhill from there. I finally figured out my son, by banging on it so much he's actually broken the screen so whatever controls I put in, he could bang on it and it would just do whatever he wanted. A month later I exchange the iPad but I nearly ripped my own hair out over this YouTube. Yeah, the addiction sunk in over those first five months of lockdown of screens and YouTube and just that misery sucking.\"\n",
    "Parent 4: \"Like I said, both my kids are on it all day. They're fully remote, both of them. Neither one of them has a full schedule so I hear my son... Because my desk is right next to his room, and I'm hearing him at like 10:00 in the morning, profanities on a game with his friend. And I'm like, I don't understand, it's a school day. Well, they don't have school, it's in between a break. So it's definitely made our day... Especially since I'm working right next to him, very difficult to try and do my job and be next to him. But it's their lives, they're in their rooms, if it's not school then it's playing games. My son plays a lot of games with his friends, my daughter doesn't but then she'll be on the YouTube also a lot, TickTock, whatever, and I kind of don't see them a lot during the day. Thankfully they do okay so I don't ask... I used to be a more involved and now I'm not really involved. Now it's a free for all.\"\n",
