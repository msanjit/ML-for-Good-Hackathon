Well, they didn't use it as much. I mean, the teachers would assign some reading or math assignments on I ready and from time to time some homework. But yeah, that was about it. I would monitor how much time they were on Roblox and other things to entertain themselves, but it was easier control them back then because they didn't have to go on as much. I mean, that's what it was.   \n",

My daughter was in fifth grade, we would have a couple in Newsela projects, half an hour of homework. But we were in the playground, neighborhood friends, after school projects, after school swimming. A little bit of tablet on the weekends, but there was no internet access and there was no YouTube in my life, there was no Roblox, there was no gaming. So, a very different world.   \n",

My high schooler had a lot of his homework that he had to type and word process... I don't know if that's the right word, into Docs, but it wasn't a huge amount. It wasn't doing research, it wasn't hours and hours. My elementary school guy, he didn't have any homework on the computer at all. And my middle schooler had very little, like type this one thing or something like that. It was very little on the computer. And for myself, in terms of my family, I lock the video games so that there was very little access to video games during the week.   \n",

There was no YouTube watching, like now YouTube consumes our life. My kids didn't even know how to use the features on our TV, the smart features, they didn't know they could access YouTube on it or anything like that. So it was very controlled and very little. I also had my children in a lot of afterschool activities. My older son was in an orchestra, he also was in a band, theater groups, there was a lot of afterschool activity. A lot of playing outside, a lot of going to the park and all that stuff. Yeah, so...   \n",

My kids probably had more... It sounds like they did more online than, so far, the rest of them. But my daughter in high school definitely had almost all of her homework... Not all of it because she was assigned in school, but she definitely was on doing homework, I feel like, a good amount. Nothing like now, but definitely was using it. My middle schooler also, but not as much. They both did play games or use Instagram, my daughter was really into Instagram, not as much anymore but definitely games. Now it's just like a free-for-all. I mean, they're in their rooms with the door shut, I have no idea what they're doing all day. I just know that they're doing their homework, getting good grades. I think they're on electronics the entire day.   \n",

He was typing away, quickly was able to navigate where to go to sign into a Google classroom. So, that was impressive in the beginning, how quickly they were able to adapt to that. So yes... I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?   \n",

So at first it seemed like a good thing, and I'm sure it is a good thing, it's just, like I said, it's just become overwhelming use of technology because they sit in front of it all day. And another thing, this use of YouTube, because I understand teachers post some things that you can look up on YouTube, so you can't block YouTube because it'll be used as a tool for one of those classes they have.   \n",

I can't even begin, it's just so bad. And transition from looking at your Google classroom or your Google meet and here's YouTube, it's just so easy. And we were not always there, we still have jobs and other things to do, can't just sit on top of them. So this accessibility of technology that has this type of content, like YouTube, that's not beneficial for kids, that's been problematic, to say the least.   \n",

And then everybody needed a device, all of a sudden everybody needed a device Needed to be on at basically the same times so we got one device from school, we bought a laptop, we found an old laptop. It was like the gathering of devices. And then teaching... My nine-year-old, teaching him how to use it, he really hadn't used computers in that way. And so teaching him how to use it. My middle son is prone to migraines and so being on the screen caused migraines and so that caused some aversion because he didn't want to be on.   \n",

I feel bad saying it, but he was kind of left to his own devices. He wasn't a big social media guy, he has no social media still, but when the only way to communicate with his peers became to use... What is it? Discord, and all these other things, that became the only way to communicate with people. And then it almost, I feel like...

People were going to bed at 1:00 in the morning, it was just totally... It felt chaotic and out of control, and it felt like the technology sputtered for a little bit as we gt devices figured out how to get everybody on and then it was this black hole that sucked you in.

And the fit that I got, screaming at me for five days until that day came, it was horrible.

My sons, they actually go to school five days out of the week. Initially we were blended and I had the same issues, the same issues with just constantly on YouTube, and constantly playing Roblox. When they were supposed to do their work I would go in and I would see them clicking out of the YouTube window. We received two laptops from the DOE as well, but before it was kind of limited because we had a desktop and we had a laptop. So before they had to take turns going on the computer if they were allowed to. They went on the computer but it was mainly on the weekends because they did play Roblox but not as often.   \n",

Yeah, it just consumed a lot of their time. My daughter, who is three, I couldn't send her to the babysitter anymore, so she was home with me while I was working from home so I would have to force her to look at YouTube too, or watch the television. So I kind of really felt bad because I had to do that so I try to always turn on something educational, like Sesame Street. But then she started telling me what she wanted to watch after a while, Nick Jr. or Netflix, so that became a problem.   \n",

I don't know what they're doing in the back. I have to tell them to go in the back because when they come home from school I still have to work so it still became a problem even though they're back in school five days out of the week. So yeah, and they still have some assignments on the computer, like homework assignments on the computer. Yeah, even if they go back to school I feel like it still would be a problem if you're having issues now with them remotely. So yeah, that's my experience.   \n",

But my son has been going for two days a week since October with the school closings and stuff. But he is happy to go. He's looking forward to go.

Using Google Classroom to directly reach out to the teacher and use the chat function has been fantastic. And then when she goes in blended she has more direct contact with the teacher. She goes in twice or three times a week with her cohort. So I like the Google Classroom set up for her as a sixth grader. Also, the smaller cohorts have been great. It's going to be, just to answer the other question, odd when it goes back to 32 kids. But I love that she can send a quick message, she gets a quick response back, and so that communication has really helped her a lot as an introvert and having those issues.   \n",

It's probably recent, in the past month or two maybe, that we get a daily update at the end of the day for my middle schooler. I at least see what he's doing, which is probably more than what I ever got from him or the school, definitely from the school, before. So, that's nice to at least get a daily rundown of... It might only be a sentence or two each, but it's at least Something. So, that's nice. And I also like that they do get immediate responses basically from teachers if they have questions on homework or questions... Whatever it might be, but everyone is pretty receptive to responding in a quick time period.   \n",

He would not participate. He did not reach out in the G chat message or whatever. So that part has not been working out for us very well. However, someone had an idea that I overheard, and so I found a tutor, just another teacher from another school who does tutoring. And so the ability to have tutoring at your fingertips without having to commute or travel, or go and wait and sit there in the car has been... And not just that, but the ability to one on one connects like this.   \n",

So that's been amazing. So the feedback that I get from his two tutors that he has... And we haven't been doing it for a long time, maybe a month or so, maybe over a month, has been been great. Overall very positive. So I'm very happy because he did need help in ELA and math and was complete lack of participation in his Google Classroom. I didn't even know what he knew and what he learned any more this past year. So the one on one ability without having to go anywhere, get dressed, drive, so that was a great deal and I hope that will stay. And I hope it will stay because, why not? There's a demand and there's a supply, I think that would be one good takeaway, some remote learning options.   \n",

My son, the only positive thing I guess about it is we don't fight about it as much. I used to have to... It's not necessarily positive, it's kind of contradictory, but I don't even tell him to get off anymore. It used to be a fight because I used to have to tell him to get off, now we don't... So the fighting has actually gone down. The flip side of that is he's just on so much more. The language has got worse on the game and I'm constantly having to stop it. But he also has gotten a little closer with some of his friends that he can't see anymore because they're online talking. And the moms and I will say, \"Did you hear they did this,\" if there's a problem. I mean, he's definitely playing more, but he played a lot beforehand too, not like this.   \n",

We didn't have any exposure to that. I can't again, he was seven years old, he's eight now, so maybe it was just a little early. But this year it just blossomed, if it's the right word, he's playing a lot. I think some of it, again, may be my fault because it's a good babysitter. If you're trying to get through your work, we all have jobs, demanding jobs, it's easier to... instead of just standing there trying to control his gaming, you're just, \"Okay, he's busy and I'm going to get my work done.\" So I think it lasted for a while and I think I just kind of gave into that convenience. Just because it truly... I also had to get my job done. Do you know?   \n",

I was able to separate his computer from gaming computer. So that works out, so far so good. I limited it, so he plays a little bit less. But in terms of positive, I also would echo what Parent 4 said, that he was able to connect a little bit more with his friends. And again, as I mentioned, he does have issues with social life, he has trouble making friends and doesn't use appropriate language with friends so sometimes they don't want to be friends with him, those type of things. While they play all these video games and they're pursuing the same goal, whatever that goal is in a game, and he was able to connect with them and speak to them, something we may not even have had, had we not been sitting at home without being able to [inaudible 00:53:56].   \n",

I would say it was just affecting their attention and they weren't focused so when I would punish them and say, \"Well, now you can't go on Roblox,\" they would get really upset, they would cry. It was like it was the end of the world for them. I think at one point I changed their password so they can't logon unless I log on for them.   \n",

I mean, I'm sitting across from my child who's supposed to be doing math work, and he's on Friday Night Funkin' or whatever it is. I don't know what it is, Roblox, whatever. I just see him over there jamming, and that's not math. He's not jamming to math. But this is what I deal with daily. I think they felt they were on vacation. This whole time they've just been on a never-ending vacation and [crosstalk 00:16:04]   \n",

As soon as they opened up, I was like, \"Okay, you got to go back.\" Well, actually I waited a little while because the numbers had gone back up for a little while and so I was concerned but there were only two other kids in his classroom, so I said let's do it. He needs the structure and there's just... Like you said, Moderator 2, I have work meetings, I mean I'm answering emails through the night practically, so I just felt like it was just better for him to be in school. But he uses an iPad for school, they use the iPad in school, which I don't love but he loves it, and then when he comes home, he wants to play on the iPad. So it's like iPad, 24/7.

Because my parents live in Connecticut, so I moved the middle child, the first-grader, Parent 2, Child 2, to a school in Connecticut. They're full-time. It is amazing. If they do close, which is very rarely, they do live synchronous learning so I don't have to be their teacher, I don't have to step away from my work day. The teacher actually answers questions.

But I mean, how can these teachers deal with this? Especially some of the schools that are really big with only one teacher that don't even have TAs and that sort of help. My kid's always been in an ICT classroom with two teachers, but in general those classes have been very big. There are still usually at least 27 kids and half of them have an IEP, and I would imagine that if my kid with her IEP is struggling, she's probably not the only one.

It's Roblox. I'm basically feeding the addiction to get the behavior change I want but it is a... Right now, we started small with some of the behavioral changes. But next week, or even really starting tomorrow, we're going to a little bigger with the iPad restriction, which we hadn't incorporated yet.

I mean, New Year's Eve with your friend, all night in Animal... I mean, it wasn't real but they were hanging out and they also video chat at the same time. It's not like hanging out with a real person, I mean it is a real person but it's not like in the same room, but it was something when she had nothing, and there's something for that.   \n",

It works too well, all of a sudden they're gone. You know what I mean? And it could be a long time. Uninterrupted time as a parent is so valuable and awesome that when it comes along, you're just doing stuff. You're just doing stuff, work, whatever it is you need to do, and then all of a sudden it's been a long time and you're like, \"I haven't seen my child all day, what have they been doing?\" That I know is not right, but it's not like... And the whole them doing school at home thing, we suck. I work at a school, I'm a school social worker, I'm great at school, I know school, but with my own child's school, I don't know what it. They're just like, \"Make sure to go in the classroom\" and blah, blah, blah. They didn't really give us really adequate instructions and stuff, and there was a whole bunch of stuff. And we'd get bad report cards every fricking day from the teachers like, \"Oh by the way, your child didn't do their homework,\" and it's a lot to keep track of and it's not easy to do that. I don't know just having her quiet, it's just so nice, but it's terrible.   \n",

So the one that has already gone back to school, when he comes home, it's just tunnel vision to get to playing the iPad. Whatever he has to do or whatever he has to not to do to get to the iPad. So that's where we are with that.   \n",

I mean, that's, I think, my biggest concern at this point is doing that. I'm hoping summer camp will help, we're definitely sending ours to summer camp, two weeks of sleep-away camp with no technology and then six weeks at day camp. Can't send a two-year-old, but I'm sending the six and eight-year-old. So I'm just curious any good resources, books, I don't know, tools, detox program from it.   \n",

I wish we had done a real laptop because I've heard you can put a lot more restrictions on them. So one of our Chromebooks died, I don't know, it just won't take a charge, and Parent 2, Child 1's is on its way out, so I think I'm going to switch her over to a laptop where I can put in a lot more restrictions.   \n",

That one's like, no. He sent us another one where you can actually like... This thing's going off. So yeah, I mean, it's a time thing. I feel like she's constantly... That's the only goal. Even if she does something, it's solely to get the iPad. Even if she's nice to someone, it's solely to get the iPad. It's like the focus of her life now. I just feel like it's made her into a less interesting kid. Like I said, it's disappointing. She was always outside and wanting to play with kids in the beginning of the pandemic, when it was just Zoom school and she really hadn't been introduced to Minecraft or Roblox or any of that stuff yet. She actually just did the class and then went outside and played. But when she discovered that over the summer, the decline was so fast into addiction, I was like, \"Wow.\"  \n",

They actually are back full-time, every grade now except for the pre-K, but I chose... She had been hybrid, and I chose to mover her to all virtual when they decided to go back full-time. The reason I did that was because of the six-foot rule, and even if it was the three-foot rule, which the UFT hasn't adopted yet, the entire second grade is in the cafeteria. So my dyslexic, ADHD kid, which is just the tip of the iceberg of her issues, is supposed to be in a cafeteria with every single second grader, no partitions, teachers using microphones, the specials are all still via computer.   \n",

And with her issues and being further behind, we just figured... And she's not doing school at home obviously, but we're hiring tutors. So we're educating her, not our school currently.   \n",

      "Moderator: So just starting to think through some of the impact of technology, can we talk a little bit about how your child used technology prior to the pandemic for school purposes? Parent 2.0: Oh okay. Well, they didn't use it as much. I mean, the teachers would assign some reading or math assignments on I ready and from time to time some homework. But yeah, that was about it. I would monitor how much time they were on Roblox and other things to entertain themselves, but it was easier control them back then because they didn't have to go on as much. I mean, that's what it was. Parent 3.0: I would say the same thing. My daughter was in fifth grade, we would have a couple in Newsela projects, half an hour of homework. But we were in the playground, neighborhood friends, after school projects, after school swimming. A little bit of tablet on the weekends, but there was no internet access and there was no YouTube in my life, there was no Roblox, there was no gaming. So, a very different world. Parent 5.0: I have a similar experience to Parent 3. My high schooler had a lot of his homework that he had to type and word process... I don't know if that's the right word, into Docs, but it wasn't a huge amount. It wasn't doing research, it wasn't hours and hours. My elementary school guy, he didn't have any homework on the computer at all. And my middle schooler had very little, like type this one thing or something like that. It was very little on the computer. And for myself, in terms of my family, I lock the video games so that there was very little access to video games during the week. Parent 5.0: And then on the weekends there was an hour or something like that, it wasn't that much. There was no YouTube watching, like now YouTube consumes our life. My kids didn't even know how to use the features on our TV, the smart features, they didn't know they could access YouTube on it or anything like that. So it was very controlled and very little. I also had my children in a lot of afterschool activities. My older son was in an orchestra, he also was in a band, theater groups, there was a lot of afterschool activity. A lot of playing outside, a lot of going to the park and all that stuff. Yeah, so... Parent 4.0: I can go. My kids probably had more... It sounds like they did more online than, so far, the rest of them. But my daughter in high school definitely had almost all of her homework... Not all of it because she was assigned in school, but she definitely was on doing homework, I feel like, a good amount. Nothing like now, but definitely was using it. My middle schooler also, but not as much. They both did play games or use Instagram, my daughter was really into Instagram, not as much anymore but definitely games. Now it's just like a free-for-all. I mean, they're in their rooms with the door shut, I have no idea what they're doing all day. I just know that they're doing their homework, getting good grades. I think they're on electronics the entire day. Parent 1.0: Yeah, so I have a similar experience with my eight-year-old. Pre-pandemic he was still in second grade so the use of computers was very limited. Maybe once a week he would type, words of the week was one of the options I picked to do. That was his only interaction with computer. Of course he had devices to play on, and he would go to his father's house every other weekend and he would be more exposed there to computers. But still he was busy. He was busy during the week, there was school, there was getting to school, getting from school, that's a trip in itself. Parent 1.0: There was hockey, we had TaeKwonDo, he was very busy. Even then it didn't seem like enough, it didn't seem like we were doing enough but he was certainly a lot busier than now. And he did get to play, mostly probably on the weekends, and again, weekends were also pretty packed. So I don't know how he had time, but he did play, not a lot. And of course we were able to control it, it was an item you had to earn and if you didn't do well then you don't get to play. So it was a tool we could use as incentive during the week. So now that's all out the window, it's all available right there all day long. And getting him away from the computer now is a project in itself every day.\n",
      "Moderator: If you can walk me through a little bit how your use of technology changed through the pandemic when they had to start using it more for school or what your situation was for your child? Parent 1.0: I can say for my eight-year-old, because again, we went from not really knowing how to use a computer or how to type, to transition really smoothly, I mean if you can call that a benefit, we transitioned really quickly. He was typing away, quickly was able to navigate where to go to sign into a Google classroom. So, that was impressive in the beginning, how quickly they were able to adapt to that. So yes... I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?\n",
      "Moderator: How the technology has changed during the pandemic, school purposes and whether it's beneficial or problematic? Parent 1.0: Right, exactly, it seems beneficial because it is an important part of your life as you grow older in high school clearly, and in middle school as Parent 4 said, there's some use of computer. So at first it seemed like a good thing, and I'm sure it is a good thing, it's just, like I said, it's just become overwhelming use of technology because they sit in front of it all day. And another thing, this use of YouTube, because I understand teachers post some things that you can look up on YouTube, so you can't block YouTube because it'll be used as a tool for one of those classes they have. Parent 1.0: But YouTube is just this bottomless hole of... I can't even begin, it's just so bad. And transition from looking at your Google classroom or your Google meet and here's YouTube, it's just so easy. And we were not always there, we still have jobs and other things to do, can't just sit on top of them. So this accessibility of technology that has this type of content, like YouTube, that's not beneficial for kids, that's been problematic, to say the least. Parent 5.0: So for us, we only had a desktop and a laptop, which was more than sufficient pre-pandemic. And then everybody needed a device, all of a sudden everybody needed a device Needed to be on at basically the same times so we got one device from school, we bought a laptop, we found an old laptop. It was like the gathering of devices. And then teaching... My nine-year-old, teaching him how to use it, he really hadn't used computers in that way. And so teaching him how to use it. My middle son is prone to migraines and so being on the screen caused migraines and so that caused some aversion because he didn't want to be on. Parent 5.0: The schedules were kind of crazy, like all over the place. And the truth is that it's hard because my 17-year-old, who knew how to do all these things just kind of stayed in his room for months. And it was just... I feel bad saying it, but he was kind of left to his own devices. He wasn't a big social media guy, he has no social media still, but when the only way to communicate with his peers became to use... What is it? Discord, and all these other things, that became the only way to communicate with people. And then it almost, I feel like... Like Parent 1 said, it's like this black hole that sucks you in. Parent 5.0: And then there was also no schedule. Because we have some special needs in our family, my schedule is really tight with my kids and so the little guys we go to bed at 8:30 and then 9:00 and then the older one was in bed by 10:00 and there was a lot of structure, and literally it was like a bomb hit it. People were going to bed at 1:00 in the morning, it was just totally... It felt chaotic and out of control, and it felt like the technology sputtered for a little bit as we gt devices figured out how to get everybody on and then it was this black hole that sucked you in. And then everybody was on for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours, and it felt out of control. Parent 3.0: Sure, when lock down happened my then first grader, the school did a great job pivoting to remote quite quickly. They used seesaw as a platform. I did get two laptops from the DOE because we have a lot of tech but it's all very old and kind of fragile and I'm like, they're going to wreck it all. Nothings insured. We're self-employed and I could just see the whole business being wiped out so we did take a DOE iPads which was a lifesaver. But also, again, we got to one point where the computer teacher did that YouTube... We were not on the YouTube and she sent one link and they figured out, \"Oh, I can get to YouTube from this link.\" Parent 3.0: And then it was like a bomb went off, they figured it out, they figured out workarounds and it was like Pandora's box. I was trying to figure out how to block... I was on the phone with the DOE, I was on the phone with a parent coordinator, I was calling the principal, like, \"How can I block YouTube without...\" I was putting timer things, it was driving me crazy, and it was downhill from there. I finally figured out my son, by banging on it so much he's actually broken the screen so whatever controls I put in, he could bang on it and it would just do whatever he wanted. A month later I exchange the iPad but I nearly ripped my own hair out over this YouTube. Yeah, the addiction sunk in over those first five months of lockdown of screens and YouTube and just that misery sucking. Parent 4.0: Like I said, both my kids are on it all day. They're fully remote, both of them. Neither one of them has a full schedule so I hear my son... Because my desk is right next to his room, and I'm hearing him at like 10:00 in the morning, profanities on a game with his friend. And I'm like, I don't understand, it's a school day. Well, they don't have school, it's in between a break. So it's definitely made our day... Especially since I'm working right next to him, very difficult to try and do my job and be next to him. But it's their lives, they're in their rooms, if it's not school then it's playing games. My son plays a lot of games with his friends, my daughter doesn't but then she'll be on the YouTube also a lot, TickTock, whatever, and I kind of don't see them a lot during the day. Thankfully they do okay so I don't ask... I used to be a more involved and now I'm not really involved. Now it's a free for all. Parent 4.0: Yeah, I don't feel like there's even much to be involved. They don't have much, especially my middle Schooler, has nothing to do so there isn't even much for me to ask him.\n",
      "Moderator: Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time? Parent 4.0: Absolutely. If you want, I can finish that. Actually I'm having problems now because my sons school said... We requested, they didn't say it, but depending on the size of the class you might be able to go in one more day. You can only go one day a week now. And I was able to get him in two days. And the fit that I got, screaming at me for five days until that day came, it was horrible. About how [inaudible 00:33:53] the worst, making him go in for two days instead of just one, so I can only imagine what's going to happen next year. Parent 2.0: I'm sorry. My sons, they actually go to school five days out of the week. Initially we were blended and I had the same issues, the same issues with just constantly on YouTube, and constantly playing Roblox. When they were supposed to do their work I would go in and I would see them clicking out of the YouTube window. We received two laptops from the DOE as well, but before it was kind of limited because we had a desktop and we had a laptop. So before they had to take turns going on the computer if they were allowed to. They went on the computer but it was mainly on the weekends because they did play Roblox but not as often. Parent 2.0: But after everything shut down I didn't have much entertainment to do besides television or talking with your friends or Roblox or Discord or whatever. Yeah, it just consumed a lot of their time. My daughter, who is three, I couldn't send her to the babysitter anymore, so she was home with me while I was working from home so I would have to force her to look at YouTube too, or watch the television. So I kind of really felt bad because I had to do that so I try to always turn on something educational, like Sesame Street. But then she started telling me what she wanted to watch after a while, Nick Jr. or Netflix, so that became a problem. Parent 2.0: But even after my son started going back to school five days out of the week it still became a problem, technology, because right after they do their homework they will go on YouTube or they go on Roblox or something. I don't know what they're doing in the back. I have to tell them to go in the back because when they come home from school I still have to work so it still became a problem even though they're back in school five days out of the week. So yeah, and they still have some assignments on the computer, like homework assignments on the computer. Yeah, even if they go back to school I feel like it still would be a problem if you're having issues now with them remotely. So yeah, that's my experience. Parent 5.0: For me, the months that I tried to work from home with my three kids was nearly impossible, like I'm sure many other people. So out of desperation, in September we decided to put my middle schooler in a private school, so he has been going five days a week with some interruptions when they close school, but there hasn't been that many. Today, I guess I got word from the elementary school that they're moving to a five day week model, I guess in two weeks. But my son has been going for two days a week since October with the school closings and stuff. But he is happy to go. He's looking forward to go. And my high schooler has also been going blended, it's interesting because sometimes... Parent 5.0: Yes, I am. This is exactly what happened all throughout the pandemic. Parent 5.0: And my high schooler, I think it's interesting because even if he's the only one, which has happened several times, he goes when he supposed to go. I was like, \"You're going to keep going?\" And he's like, \"Yeah, I'm going to go.\" And I'm like, \"Okay.\" So I personally don't anticipate any issues. He's graduating, I think that's also part of it, because I think they missed out on their whole senior year and everything that they were looking forward to so just being able to go and see teachers and stuff like that, he I think wants that connection with people. So when he supposed to go, which is kind of like one day a week, maybe sometimes two days a week, they have this weird schedule that I still can't figure out, he's been going, he goes. So with my kids, they have bought into going back to school. Parent 4.0: My son has been on a 2-3 day week model since January. Before that it was 1-2 days a week I think. But between all the quarantines and the school closures because of those two case rules that they had we were in quarantine all the time until... Hopefully going forward it will be better, but we were in school barely, mostly all remote because of all that. But we've gone a few times for sure. My son, he's on the spectrum so he has all these social/emotional issues that usually prevent him from being able to get along with children. All prior to the school year... We did start a new school this year, so in September we went to a new school that we've attended this year, which was a group of 7-8 kids, when he was in person because of the cohorts. So maybe that has to do with an overall positive experience for him on the days that he did go in person, compared to the prior years when he was one of 32 with all these issues that he had that we didn't even address until this year. Parent 4.0: And as a matter fact we just actually got placed in the NES program so hopefully next year he will... Even though it was a difficult decision to make because we just started a new school this year, new school next year, but I understand it would benefit him and sort of tailored to the exact issues that he has. But in terms of him going back in person, it has been an overall positive experience, he is not protesting or anything. He was able to even make some friends even though they're social distancing with masks on and everything. So I was surprised and happy about that. Parent 4.0: Hopefully that will continue, but again, he will go to this program in September, he'll be in a smaller class size. Because I think the 32 kids that we've always had was overwhelming for him and he couldn't get along with anyone and it was just daily calls from school and nobody really ever addressed the issues that he had. It was always just like, he's that kid, type of thing. All the tears that were cried by me. So yeah, so I think... He actually even said the other day, \"Oh yes, I'm going...\" Because I remind him advance to prepare him that tomorrow is in person. He said, \"Oh yeah, I'll have something else to do than to play Roblox. Parent 4.0: Exactly. So I think this is actually one of the silver linings for me with the pandemic, is kids that have issues, sort of like some of our children, when there's a big class size and one teacher and all that, they may not have a good experience I may not want to go back there. But so far, in our case, I think due to the smaller class size, due to having a little more, I guess, personal attention from the teacher who is able to expand herself for the seven kids, it was overall good. It was actually better than the years before.\n",
      "Moderator: Any positive parts you would like to see continue, or are there parts that you're really hoping would end as we go back? Parent 3.0: The Google Classrooms, since my daughter has very little executive functioning, she has social anxiety and ADHD, just being able to use the chat function since she'll never raise her hand and she'll never ask for help. Using Google Classroom to directly reach out to the teacher and use the chat function has been fantastic. And then when she goes in blended she has more direct contact with the teacher. She goes in twice or three times a week with her cohort. So I like the Google Classroom set up for her as a sixth grader. Also, the smaller cohorts have been great. It's going to be, just to answer the other question, odd when it goes back to 32 kids. But I love that she can send a quick message, she gets a quick response back, and so that communication has really helped her a lot as an introvert and having those issues. Parent 4.0: Yeah, same thing with Google Classroom. It's probably recent, in the past month or two maybe, that we get a daily update at the end of the day for my middle schooler. I at least see what he's doing, which is probably more than what I ever got from him or the school, definitely from the school, before. So, that's nice to at least get a daily rundown of... It might only be a sentence or two each, but it's at least Something. So, that's nice. And I also like that they do get immediate responses basically from teachers if they have questions on homework or questions... Whatever it might be, but everyone is pretty receptive to responding in a quick time period. Parent 1.0: So my son, Google Classroom, it was not a good experience because he would not put his camera on, he would just hide behind his camera. He would not participate. He did not reach out in the G chat message or whatever. So that part has not been working out for us very well. However, someone had an idea that I overheard, and so I found a tutor, just another teacher from another school who does tutoring. And so the ability to have tutoring at your fingertips without having to commute or travel, or go and wait and sit there in the car has been... And not just that, but the ability to one on one connects like this. Parent 1.0: So the one teacher, who is... and not in a very formal way like his teacher, in a less formal way. So that's been amazing. So the feedback that I get from his two tutors that he has... And we haven't been doing it for a long time, maybe a month or so, maybe over a month, has been been great. Overall very positive. So I'm very happy because he did need help in ELA and math and was complete lack of participation in his Google Classroom. I didn't even know what he knew and what he learned any more this past year. So the one on one ability without having to go anywhere, get dressed, drive, so that was a great deal and I hope that will stay. And I hope it will stay because, why not? There's a demand and there's a supply, I think that would be one good takeaway, some remote learning options. Parent 2.0: The only thing I probably would miss about using technology is the communication with the schools and the teachers. It was easier to communicate– Parent 2.0: Yes, having direct contact with the teachers and the schools ,instead of the school sending a bunch of print outs with the children in folders, that became overwhelming, all the paper. The teachers, they were able to reach out to me immediately. I mean, not that they weren't doing that before, but I think it became easier to do because it just became that platform that everyone was using. I believe my school, they use Class Dojo as a way to communicate. I think the platform that they used for the students in the school work was iLearn and I didn't really like it so I'm kind of glad... Parent 2.0: I mean, now that they're going to school five days a week they don't need to use that. I think only the children who are remote use it, but I didn't really like it, it wasn't intuitive and I wasn't able to view the assignments, both of their assignments to make sure that they did it. And then some things they were able to do online, but somethings they had to print out, so it was kind of all over the place. So yeah, the only thing I would appreciate that they continue doing is using it as a way to communicate with the parents, that's all.\n",
      "Moderator: I'd like to hear from you guys, what was your child's gaming use before the pandemic, did you see it as beneficial? Did you have concerns before? And then, how has that gaming use changed since the pandemic started, any benefits? Parent 4.0: My daughter never did gaming before. I mean, years ago she did Minecraft, but not anything recently. She does other stuff online and is on there a lot, but as far as gaming, no. My son, the only positive thing I guess about it is we don't fight about it as much. I used to have to... It's not necessarily positive, it's kind of contradictory, but I don't even tell him to get off anymore. It used to be a fight because I used to have to tell him to get off, now we don't... So the fighting has actually gone down. The flip side of that is he's just on so much more. The language has got worse on the game and I'm constantly having to stop it. But he also has gotten a little closer with some of his friends that he can't see anymore because they're online talking. And the moms and I will say, \"Did you hear they did this,\" if there's a problem. I mean, he's definitely playing more, but he played a lot beforehand too, not like this. Parent 4.0: It was at the beginning. At the beginning of all of this, it was. Then after I realized that there's nothing else for him to do... I mean, at one point he had a broken ankle so he couldn't even play his sports, even take a walk. Then I'm like, what am I going to... Unless I'm prepared to sit there and entertain him or teach him myself, which I can't when I'm working, I have no choice. Parent 1.0: As I mentioned, we did not play a lot, certainly some of these video that involve multiplayer or whatever, when they have to chat with each other and they can do it together. We didn't have any exposure to that. I can't again, he was seven years old, he's eight now, so maybe it was just a little early. But this year it just blossomed, if it's the right word, he's playing a lot. I think some of it, again, may be my fault because it's a good babysitter. If you're trying to get through your work, we all have jobs, demanding jobs, it's easier to... instead of just standing there trying to control his gaming, you're just, \"Okay, he's busy and I'm going to get my work done.\" So I think it lasted for a while and I think I just kind of gave into that convenience. Just because it truly... I also had to get my job done. Do you know? Parent 1.0: So I think I gave into that and I just kind of let it go until I realized it's 12:00 and just out of control, so I decided to regain some control successfully. I was able to separate his computer from gaming computer. So that works out, so far so good. I limited it, so he plays a little bit less. But in terms of positive, I also would echo what Parent 4 said, that he was able to connect a little bit more with his friends. And again, as I mentioned, he does have issues with social life, he has trouble making friends and doesn't use appropriate language with friends so sometimes they don't want to be friends with him, those type of things. While they play all these video games and they're pursuing the same goal, whatever that goal is in a game, and he was able to connect with them and speak to them, something we may not even have had, had we not been sitting at home without being able to [inaudible 00:53:56]. Parent 2.0: Well, for me the gaming, I was able to control it a little more before the pandemic, but now I noticed that it's starting getting out of control. Once I noticed that they were sneaking to go on Roblox and YouTube instead of doing their work. And then once I seen that it was... I would say it was just affecting their attention and they weren't focused so when I would punish them and say, \"Well, now you can't go on Roblox,\" they would get really upset, they would cry. It was like it was the end of the world for them. I think at one point I changed their password so they can't logon unless I log on for them. Parent 2.0: But they learned that if they never log off, if they were to just leave it, they can just open the page back up. So I didn't realize that that was happening. I'm like, \"Wait, how are you on Roblox? Oh, you never logged off.\" So on Sunday evenings I have to make sure I've logged them off. Because I would let them play after they did their work, but they weren't really doing that great in school so then I just said no more Roblox during the week. Yeah, so I try to control it but it's still hard because then they still have YouTube that they watch and it's just... Parent 2.0: But I guess one positive outcome is the fact that they were communicating with their friends, with their cousin who lives far away, or whatever. They have a better social life. Because before they wouldn't talk to anybody but now they communicate, they keep in touch. But now it's just regaining the control back and getting them to understand that there's a time and place for everything and you shouldn't allow these things to consume your time. It's frustrating for me after a while. I'm like, \"Wait, you guys have been on the computer all day. No. You guys, no, it's time to give this a break.\" Then they'll get upset and it's an argument. So yeah, that's it for me. Parent 5.0: I can say that initially with my high schooler I felt like he got almost depressed. He was a very good academic student, he had some social issues but academically he was doing very well, a 90-something average. And he started failing all his classes. He wasn't attending, he wasn't going, he was in bed all day. I would talk to him and I was the one that said, \"Well, why don't you try maybe connecting with your friends?\" Because he didn't have social media so I was like, \"Why don't you try connecting with your friends? Maybe play a game with them or send them a message and see how they're doing.\" That helped, to connect, but then the connection is all now on this... Parent 5.0: I don't even know, he plays Minecraft I think. Then it was like two hours, and four hours, and six hours, and eight hours, and 10 hours, and 12 hours, 14 hours, or 16 hours. It was crazy. And so much so, I took the boys to Florida, we drove to Florida over the summer to see my brother and even at my brother's house, his cousins were here there and he had the pool and stuff like that and he would spend 10 hours, 12 hours, 14 hours a day stuck in a room. And he would get upset if I would say, \"No, we're going to go out. We're going to take a walk. Or let's go swimming.\" It just became... And still it's very hard to get a handle on it at 17. It's very, very hard, I feel, to get a handle on it. I'm like, \"You need to go to bed.\" Even last night, it was 1:00 in the morning and I go, \"You're going to go to school tomorrow, you should go to bed.\" Parent 5.0: And it's like, am I going to rip his laptop out of his room and we're going to fight? I don't want to do that, I tried to do that a couple of times and it just wasn't worth it to me. I just say to him, \"Look, you are becoming a young adult. You're going to have to make decisions for yourself. This isn't life, you can't game for 16 hours a day.\" So with my younger ones it also feels out of control, but it feels the most out of control with my 17-year-old because he's like six feet tall, he has– Parent 5.0: Yeah, when he was younger I used to look at his phone and monitor and all this kind of stuff but now it's very hard to know the line and it's very hard to... He had social issues very similar to what Parent 1 was talking about. And now he has these friends, these online friends. He's never had a crew and now he has this crew and they all want to play with him and, \"Matthew, are you coming on?\" So yeah, it's– Parent 3.0: Okay, with gaming, very similar to everybody here. It was a little bit of a problem the summer before. We go up north, up to Maine where my mom grew up, and if you turn on the TV the first two channels are French. So I said, \"Sorry, the TV speaks French.\" And that's it, it's never gone further than that. So I've managed up to this point to keep them off. We've got an old VCR that plays movies. I've been able to keep them off tablets for all this time. And now, with the pandemic, I had a concussion last year and it was like, all bets are off. They were just on devices and they were using the phone, they were FaceTime-ing their friends on the devices. Parent 3.0: And now we're at the point where my son says all the friends have moved away, we're in downtown Manhattan and all the friends have left so my son says, \"I have no friends.\" Calls up a friend and then he'll be on for three hours, or four, five, or six, seven. My daughter has made an alternative account, I just found out, and she's trolling on Roblox. She's 11, [inaudible 01:01:54], people who are dating, and she will troll them. So that's something to be proud of for me. It's just a nightmare. So now I'm looking at software that I can block the whole thing down. I've put a padlock on where our desktop computer is, on the door, and she'll hide the lock. I'm like, \"Where is the padlock?\" And I've thrown all the devices in, or I'll rip the router out of the wall. I mean, it's gotten very ugly and I scream an awful lot. So yeah, it's not pretty.\n"

      "Moderator: But in terms of technology use for school, how did your child or children use technology for school purposes before the pandemic? Parent 3.0: Hi. My name is Parent 3. I showed up a little late, sorry everyone. So I have two sons, ages 7 and 10. They had very little interaction with electronics before the pandemic and now this is all... I mean, I'm sitting across from my child who's supposed to be doing math work, and he's on Friday Night Funkin' or whatever it is. I don't know what it is, Roblox, whatever. I just see him over there jamming, and that's not math. He's not jamming to math. But this is what I deal with daily. I think they felt they were on vacation. This whole time they've just been on a never-ending vacation and [crosstalk 00:16:04] Parent 2.0: I mean, I feel like my kids are watching a lot of inappropriate YouTube stuff too, stuff that I definitely don't really want them exposed to that much, and I just am working and they know that they're over there on YouTube. And it's just one video, and then it brings up 50 other videos that you can click on. I feel like they just get progressively worse. I mean, sometimes I'll overhear it and I'll be like, \"Change that.\"\n",
      "Moderator: In terms of returning to in-person school, have your children started to return to school yet? Parent nan: nan\n",
      "Moderator: How has the return been in terms of their technology use? Parent 3.0: So I have one at home still with me, and the other one, the older one, I sent back to school. He has autism and ADHD. The one that's here has ADHD. So he is getting speech and OT and all of that, and it was better to just send him back. As soon as they opened up, I was like, \"Okay, you got to go back.\" Well, actually I waited a little while because the numbers had gone back up for a little while and so I was concerned but there were only two other kids in his classroom, so I said let's do it. He needs the structure and there's just... Like you said, Moderator 2, I have work meetings, I mean I'm answering emails through the night practically, so I just felt like it was just better for him to be in school. But he uses an iPad for school, they use the iPad in school, which I don't love but he loves it, and then when he comes home, he wants to play on the iPad. So it's like iPad, 24/7. So it's a lot. Parent 2.0: Yeah, we are back. So I didn't mention I had two other kids, I guess I should, so we've sort of taken an approach that we had the ability... Because my parents live in Connecticut, so I moved the middle child, the first-grader, Parent 2, Child 2, to a school in Connecticut. They're full-time. It is amazing. If they do close, which is very rarely, they do live synchronous learning so I don't have to be their teacher, I don't have to step away from my work day. The teacher actually answers questions. My little guy's two, so he is in pretend school/daycare. \n",
      "Moderator: In terms of challenges in returning to school, what do you expect in the future your children will struggle with in terms of being back in the classroom full-time? Parent 3.0: I know for me, my biggest concern is I've seen his ADHD spike, I guess, since he's been home. Maybe it's always been there, it's just that I have my eye on it now. He's in front of me so I could really tell that it's escalating or whatever, and I'm just really nervous that when he goes back into the classroom they won't be able to control him or they won't be able to teach him. I just think he's going to be out of hand. He's going to be off schedule. Just not used to being regimented in any way, and I think it's a ... I'm nervous about him going back, I'll put it like that. Parent 2.0: But to also play on that, I agree, I have a lot of the same concerns. But I also anticipate there being so many kids like that that it's just a disaster in that classroom. I feel like so many kids are going to be such hot messes with various issues, maybe ADHD, maybe they're super behind in writing now or [crosstalk 00:25:52] issues and they're struggling. I mean, I feel like so many kids have regressed and the social anxiety and there's just so many things. I just feel like how can the teachers... And that's one of the reason I'm trying to take this show over to private for my one with all the issues, is because they're so small, and those kids have been in full-time [inaudible 00:26:13] my kid that's a problem kid. But I mean, how can these teachers deal with this? Especially some of the schools that are really big with only one teacher that don't even have TAs and that sort of help. My kid's always been in an ICT classroom with two teachers, but in general those classes have been very big. There are still usually at least 27 kids and half of them have an IEP, and I would imagine that if my kid with her IEP is struggling, she's probably not the only one. So I would think that it's going to be a bit of a disaster. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe that's just the pessimist in me. \n",
      "Moderator: I wanted to ask a couple of other questions in terms of gaming and your children because a lot of you have mentioned Roblox, which is something that my kids play as well, how did your children's use of gaming... What was it like before the pandemic? Parent 4.0: I'm sorry, I joined late, I do have an answer to this if you'd like it. My name's Parent 4. My daughter's name is Parent 4, Child 1. She was not a player of video games. We had a pandemic birthday last year, we're coming on the same... It's the same time from last year, but we were desperate to save the day and try to make some happiness out of something terrible and we bought her a Nintendo Switch, which has been great and terrible at the exact same time. She has been able to foster really good relationships with friends that she already knew and deepen those relationships.  Parent 2.0: I mean, I have said before we really didn't do games before the pandemic, but sort of a good and bad thing. I mean, now that she's obsessed and addicted, and we've started cognitive behavioral therapy for her, we're about three weeks in, but guess what we're using to bribe her behavior, that she can earn? It's Roblox. I'm basically feeding the addiction to get the behavior change I want but it is a... Right now, we started small with some of the behavioral changes. But next week, or even really starting tomorrow, we're going to a little bigger with the iPad restriction, which we hadn't incorporated yet. He wanted to do a couple weeks of just go small before we go big, but it's still using Roblox as basically a bribery tool/reward on the cognitive behavioral reward chart. So I feel like as much as I'm hating it, I'm also feeding it. Parent 1.0: So my son was [inaudible 00:30:38] before the pandemic started [inaudible 00:30:38] and I always had a problem with it. Personally, I wasn't a gamer and so I didn't get it and [inaudible 00:30:50]. But I guess sort of in the pandemic, [inaudible 00:30:59] video game addiction webinar that I listened to, and it was really helpful because it just sort of laid [inaudible 00:31:11] there re positives and there are negatives, and you should worry if it gets to the point where they're not eating, [inaudible 00:31:19] interested in other things. And I think the interest in other things was [inaudible 00:31:24].  Parent 4.0: It allowed my daughter to spend time with friends when everything was locked down. It was a way for her to actually be with other kids. On New Year's Eve, she spent a lot of time with her friend in Animal Crossing, that's like the coolest thing I've ever heard of. I mean, New Year's Eve with your friend, all night in Animal... I mean, it wasn't real but they were hanging out and they also video chat at the same time. It's not like hanging out with a real person, I mean it is a real person but it's not like in the same room, but it was something when she had nothing, and there's something for that.\n",
      "Moderator: But it sounds like a lot of your share the same experience of pre-pandemic your children didn't have a lot to do with gaming and being online often and during the pandemic that shifted to being partially a large problem, partially something that you've depended on to give them some socialization and some sort of sense of normalcy. Is that correct? Parent 3.0: I would say so. Also me though, my boys did play games before the pandemic, it's just it's magnified now. It's more games now. We also got them both Switchs I think in the last year or so, the Switchs add to it. They each have an iPad now. It's too much. Plus the school iPads.  Parent 4.0: I'm going to say I've experienced the same thing. It works too well, all of a sudden they're gone. You know what I mean? And it could be a long time. Uninterrupted time as a parent is so valuable and awesome that when it comes along, you're just doing stuff. You're just doing stuff, work, whatever it is you need to do, and then all of a sudden it's been a long time and you're like, \"I haven't seen my child all day, what have they been doing?\" That I know is not right, but it's not like... And the whole them doing school at home thing, we suck. I work at a school, I'm a school social worker, I'm great at school, I know school, but with my own child's school, I don't know what it. They're just like, \"Make sure to go in the classroom\" and blah, blah, blah. They didn't really give us really adequate instructions and stuff, and there was a whole bunch of stuff. And we'd get bad report cards every fricking day from the teachers like, \"Oh by the way, your child didn't do their homework,\" and it's a lot to keep track of and it's not easy to do that. I don't know just having her quiet, it's just so nice, but it's terrible. Parent 1.0: But yeah, if we gave him any slack, any space, he would be on either Roblox or he would be watching [inaudible 00:38:15] so I had to be on top of it [inaudible 00:38:19] and he wasn't even... They had an hour and 45 minutes where they were [inaudible 00:38:37] and they were asked to just [inaudible 00:38:54].\n",
      "Moderator: In terms of looking at the full return to school, how do you think you will be impacted and how do you think your child will be impacted in terms of their use of gaming? Parent 1.0: Since I feel like there's already full-time back in school, that transition was... We definitely had to start getting feedback from his teacher, we are using Roblox as an incentive for him to be engaged in school, so we had to sort of support [inaudible 00:40:06] to do. And he still complains about, \"Oh, I only have two hours to play\" when he gets home after school, and we're like, \"You [inaudible 00:40:21].\" So he complains about it and we have to sort of incentivize [inaudible 00:40:24] school to help him [inaudible 00:40:27]. Parent 2.0: For my one kid that's already back at school she basically plays it until the moment she steps into that school or out of my car. And the moment she gets off the bus and I get her home, she's back on it again until she goes to bed. I mean, I guess it's better in the sense that she has several hours that's she's not on it, but it's all about that from the moment she wakes up till the moment she goes to bed. I mean, it's still an issue in terms of, I think, just socialization and stuff.  Parent 3.0: I know for me it's an issue just because they don't want to do anything else. Socialization is not even a problem. They just want to eat and play video games. My 10-year-old will actually say, \"I just want to play,\" that's it. I have to fight with them to do school work.  Parent 3.0: But that's been our biggest issue. So the one that has already gone back to school, when he comes home, it's just tunnel vision to get to playing the iPad. Whatever he has to do or whatever he has to not to do to get to the iPad. So that's where we are with that. Parent 2.0: I'm mostly curious of how would we get them off it, the best way to transition them back into society, I feel like, instead of their virtual world. I mean, that's, I think, my biggest concern at this point is doing that. I'm hoping summer camp will help, we're definitely sending ours to summer camp, two weeks of sleep-away camp with no technology and then six weeks at day camp. Can't send a two-year-old, but I'm sending the six and eight-year-old. So I'm just curious any good resources, books, I don't know, tools, detox program from it. Parent 4.0: I just think that there are some things about video games. I think that's there's problem-solving, if there's reading involved, there's... I can't believe how much she's been able to learn about Minecraft. It's amazing. There are skills involved in this. It's not entirely useless. It's just, how do we capitalize on the good and mitigate the bad? And I think that that's really hard. I mean, I just wish that my kid would be as interested in doing her homework to the extent that she's interested in... I don't know. I can't believe what she's acquired in Animal Crossing. She's not even interested in it anymore, but her island got three or four stars or whatever. There's merit to it, I guess, is where I'm coming from. I would hate that the only answer would be to never do it again or to not do it at all, or to do it so little that whatever good would... I don't know. Parent 1.0: Okay. Sorry about that. I have to say that my son has been able to have some really successful social interactions. When we say it's time to go out, time to go and do something, and we sort of force the issue, he has a lot of fun and he usually really gets engaged in things. That's something that we were... A huge challenge to do before, like we would go to the park and he'd be like, \"I just want to go home.\" He'd be uncomfortable or insecure about social interaction. And I feel like he's gotten so much more confident by not having that [inaudible 00:46:53] social interaction but actually this virtual version of it. It feels like he's gotten more confidence. So there is good things about this, but we have to really force him to have those in-person experiences. So that's where I've been trying to just focus on like, \"What are we going to do? What are we going to do do instead of video games?\" [inaudible 00:47:19] swimming every week now, just figuring out what we can offer to him that [inaudible 00:47:27].\n"

       "      <td>Moderator: So just starting to think through some of the impact of technology, can we talk a little bit about how your child used technology prior to the pandemic for school purposes?Parent 2.0: Oh okay. Well, they didn't use it as much. I mean, the teachers would assign some reading or math assignments on I ready and from time to time some homework. But yeah, that was about it. I would monitor how much time they were on Roblox and other things to entertain themselves, but it was easier control them back then because they didn't have to go on as much. I mean, that's what it was.Parent 3.0: I would say the same thing. My daughter was in fifth grade, we would have a couple in Newsela projects, half an hour of homework. But we were in the playground, neighborhood friends, after school projects, after school swimming. A little bit of tablet on the weekends, but there was no internet access and there was no YouTube in my life, there was no Roblox, there was no gaming. So, a very different world.Parent 5.0: I have a similar experience to Parent 3. My high schooler had a lot of his homework that he had to type and word process... I don't know if that's the right word, into Docs, but it wasn't a huge amount. It wasn't doing research, it wasn't hours and hours. My elementary school guy, he didn't have any homework on the computer at all. And my middle schooler had very little, like type this one thing or something like that. It was very little on the computer. And for myself, in terms of my family, I lock the video games so that there was very little access to video games during the week.Parent 5.0: And then on the weekends there was an hour or something like that, it wasn't that much. There was no YouTube watching, like now YouTube consumes our life. My kids didn't even know how to use the features on our TV, the smart features, they didn't know they could access YouTube on it or anything like that. So it was very controlled and very little. I also had my children in a lot of afterschool activities. My older son was in an orchestra, he also was in a band, theater groups, there was a lot of afterschool activity. A lot of playing outside, a lot of going to the park and all that stuff. Yeah, so...Parent 4.0: I can go. My kids probably had more... It sounds like they did more online than, so far, the rest of them. But my daughter in high school definitely had almost all of her homework... Not all of it because she was assigned in school, but she definitely was on doing homework, I feel like, a good amount. Nothing like now, but definitely was using it. My middle schooler also, but not as much. They both did play games or use Instagram, my daughter was really into Instagram, not as much anymore but definitely games. Now it's just like a free-for-all. I mean, they're in their rooms with the door shut, I have no idea what they're doing all day. I just know that they're doing their homework, getting good grades. I think they're on electronics the entire day.Parent 1.0: Yeah, so I have a similar experience with my eight-year-old. Pre-pandemic he was still in second grade so the use of computers was very limited. Maybe once a week he would type, words of the week was one of the options I picked to do. That was his only interaction with computer. Of course he had devices to play on, and he would go to his father's house every other weekend and he would be more exposed there to computers. But still he was busy. He was busy during the week, there was school, there was getting to school, getting from school, that's a trip in itself.Parent 1.0: There was hockey, we had TaeKwonDo, he was very busy. Even then it didn't seem like enough, it didn't seem like we were doing enough but he was certainly a lot busier than now. And he did get to play, mostly probably on the weekends, and again, weekends were also pretty packed. So I don't know how he had time, but he did play, not a lot. And of course we were able to control it, it was an item you had to ...</td>\n",

He was typing away, quickly was able to navigate where to go to sign into a Google classroom. So, that was impressive in the beginning, how quickly they were able to adapt to that. So yes...

       "      <td>Moderator: How the technology has changed during the pandemic, school purposes and whether it's beneficial or problematic?Parent 1.0: Right, exactly, it seems beneficial because it is an important part of your life as you grow older in high school clearly, and in middle school as Parent 4 said, there's some use of computer. So at first it seemed like a good thing, and I'm sure it is a good thing, it's just, like I said, it's just become overwhelming use of technology because they sit in front of it all day. And another thing, this use of YouTube, because I understand teachers post some things that you can look up on YouTube, so you can't block YouTube because it'll be used as a tool for one of those classes they have.Parent 1.0: But YouTube is just this bottomless hole of... I can't even begin, it's just so bad. And transition from looking at your Google classroom or your Google meet and here's YouTube, it's just so easy. And we were not always there, we still have jobs and other things to do, can't just sit on top of them. So this accessibility of technology that has this type of content, like YouTube, that's not beneficial for kids, that's been problematic, to say the least.Parent 5.0: So for us, we only had a desktop and a laptop, which was more than sufficient pre-pandemic. And then everybody needed a device, all of a sudden everybody needed a device Needed to be on at basically the same times so we got one device from school, we bought a laptop, we found an old laptop. It was like the gathering of devices. And then teaching... My nine-year-old, teaching him how to use it, he really hadn't used computers in that way. And so teaching him how to use it. My middle son is prone to migraines and so being on the screen caused migraines and so that caused some aversion because he didn't want to be on.Parent 5.0: The schedules were kind of crazy, like all over the place. And the truth is that it's hard because my 17-year-old, who knew how to do all these things just kind of stayed in his room for months. And it was just... I feel bad saying it, but he was kind of left to his own devices. He wasn't a big social media guy, he has no social media still, but when the only way to communicate with his peers became to use... What is it? Discord, and all these other things, that became the only way to communicate with people. And then it almost, I feel like... Like Parent 1 said, it's like this black hole that sucks you in.Parent 5.0: And then there was also no schedule. Because we have some special needs in our family, my schedule is really tight with my kids and so the little guys we go to bed at 8:30 and then 9:00 and then the older one was in bed by 10:00 and there was a lot of structure, and literally it was like a bomb hit it. People were going to bed at 1:00 in the morning, it was just totally... It felt chaotic and out of control, and it felt like the technology sputtered for a little bit as we gt devices figured out how to get everybody on and then it was this black hole that sucked you in. And then everybody was on for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours, and it felt out of control.Parent 3.0: Sure, when lock down happened my then first grader, the school did a great job pivoting to remote quite quickly. They used seesaw as a platform. I did get two laptops from the DOE because we have a lot of tech but it's all very old and kind of fragile and I'm like, they're going to wreck it all. Nothings insured. We're self-employed and I could just see the whole business being wiped out so we did take a DOE iPads which was a lifesaver. But also, again, we got to one point where the computer teacher did that YouTube... We were not on the YouTube and she sent one link and they figured out, \"Oh, I can get to YouTube from this link.\"Parent 3.0: And then it was like a bomb went off, they figured it out, they figured out workarounds and it was like Pandora's box. I was trying to figure out how to block... I was on the phone with t...</td>\n",

Actually I'm having problems now because my sons school said... We requested, they didn't say it, but depending on the size of the class you might be able to go in one more day. You can only go one day a week now. And I was able to get him in two days. And the fit that I got, screaming at me for five days until that day came, it was horrible. About how [inaudible 00:33:53] the worst, making him go in for two days instead of just one, so I can only imagine what's going to happen next year.Parent 2.0: I'm sorry. My sons, they actually go to school five days out of the week. Initially we were blended and I had the same issues, the same issues with just constantly on YouTube, and constantly playing Roblox. When they were supposed to do their work I would go in and I would see them clicking out of the YouTube window. We received two laptops from the DOE as well, but before it was kind of limited because we had a desktop and we had a laptop. So before they had to take turns going on the computer if they were allowed to. They went on the computer but it was mainly on the weekends because they did play Roblox but not as often.Parent 2.0: But after everything shut down I didn't have much entertainment to do besides television or talking with your friends or Roblox or Discord or whatever. Yeah, it just consumed a lot of their time. My daughter, who is three, I couldn't send her to the babysitter anymore, so she was home with me while I was working from home so I would have to force her to look at YouTube too, or watch the television. So I kind of really felt bad because I had to do that so I try to always turn on something educational, like Sesame Street. But then she started telling me what she wanted to watch after a while, Nick Jr. or Netflix, so that became a problem.Parent 2.0: But even after my son started going back to school five days out of the week it still became a problem, technology, because right after they do their homework they will go on YouTube or they go on Roblox or something. I don't know what they're doing in the back. I have to tell them to go in the back because when they come home from school I still have to work so it still became a problem even though they're back in school five days out of the week. So yeah, and they still have some assignments on the computer, like homework assignments on the computer. Yeah, even if they go back to school I feel like it still would be a problem if you're having issues now with them remotely. So yeah, that's my experience.Parent 5.0: For me, the months that I tried to work from home with my three kids was nearly impossible, like I'm sure many other people. So out of desperation, in September we decided to put my middle schooler in a private school, so he has been going five days a week with some interruptions when they close school, but there hasn't been that many. Today, I guess I got word from the elementary school that they're moving to a five day week model, I guess in two weeks. But my son has been going for two days a week since October with the school closings and stuff. But he is happy to go. He's looking forward to go. And my high schooler has also been going blended, it's interesting because sometimes...Parent 5.0: Yes, I am. This is exactly what happened all throughout the pandemic.Parent 5.0: And my high schooler, I think it's interesting because even if he's the only one, which has happened several times, he goes when he supposed to go. I was like, \"You're going to keep going?\" And he's like, \"Yeah, I'm going to go.\" And I'm like, \"Okay.\" So I personally don't anticipate any issues. He's graduating, I think that's also part of it, because I think they missed out on their whole senior year and everything that they were looking forward to so just being able to go and see teachers and stuff like that,...</td>\n",

       "      <td>Moderator: Any positive parts you would like to see continue, or are there parts that you're really hoping would end as we go back?Parent 3.0: The Google Classrooms, since my daughter has very little executive functioning, she has social anxiety and ADHD, just being able to use the chat function since she'll never raise her hand and she'll never ask for help. Using Google Classroom to directly reach out to the teacher and use the chat function has been fantastic. And then when she goes in blended she has more direct contact with the teacher. She goes in twice or three times a week with her cohort. So I like the Google Classroom set up for her as a sixth grader. Also, the smaller cohorts have been great. It's going to be, just to answer the other question, odd when it goes back to 32 kids. But I love that she can send a quick message, she gets a quick response back, and so that communication has really helped her a lot as an introvert and having those issues.Parent 4.0: Yeah, same thing with Google Classroom. It's probably recent, in the past month or two maybe, that we get a daily update at the end of the day for my middle schooler. I at least see what he's doing, which is probably more than what I ever got from him or the school, definitely from the school, before. So, that's nice to at least get a daily rundown of... It might only be a sentence or two each, but it's at least Something. So, that's nice. And I also like that they do get immediate responses basically from teachers if they have questions on homework or questions... Whatever it might be, but everyone is pretty receptive to responding in a quick time period.Parent 1.0: So my son, Google Classroom, it was not a good experience because he would not put his camera on, he would just hide behind his camera. He would not participate. He did not reach out in the G chat message or whatever. So that part has not been working out for us very well. However, someone had an idea that I overheard, and so I found a tutor, just another teacher from another school who does tutoring. And so the ability to have tutoring at your fingertips without having to commute or travel, or go and wait and sit there in the car has been... And not just that, but the ability to one on one connects like this.Parent 1.0: So the one teacher, who is... and not in a very formal way like his teacher, in a less formal way. So that's been amazing. So the feedback that I get from his two tutors that he has... And we haven't been doing it for a long time, maybe a month or so, maybe over a month, has been been great. Overall very positive. So I'm very happy because he did need help in ELA and math and was complete lack of participation in his Google Classroom. I didn't even know what he knew and what he learned any more this past year. So the one on one ability without having to go anywhere, get dressed, drive, so that was a great deal and I hope that will stay. And I hope it will stay because, why not? There's a demand and there's a supply, I think that would be one good takeaway, some remote learning options.Parent 2.0: The only thing I probably would miss about using technology is the communication with the schools and the teachers. It was easier to communicate–Parent 2.0: Yes, having direct contact with the teachers and the schools ,instead of the school sending a bunch of print outs with the children in folders, that became overwhelming, all the paper. The teachers, they were able to reach out to me immediately. I mean, not that they weren't doing that before, but I think it became easier to do because it just became that platform that everyone was using. I believe my school, they use Class Dojo as a way to communicate. I think the platform that they used for the students in the school work was iLearn and I didn't really like it so I'm kind of glad...Parent 2.0: I mean, now that they're going to school five days a week they don't need to use that. I think only the children who are remote use it, but...</td>\n",

       "0  Moderator: So just starting to think through some of the impact of technology, can we talk a little bit about how your child used technology prior to the pandemic for school purposes?Parent 2.0: Oh okay. Well, they didn't use it as much. I mean, the teachers would assign some reading or math assignments on I ready and from time to time some homework. But yeah, that was about it. I would monitor how much time they were on Roblox and other things to entertain themselves, but it was easier control them back then because they didn't have to go on as much. I mean, that's what it was.Parent 3.0: I would say the same thing. My daughter was in fifth grade, we would have a couple in Newsela projects, half an hour of homework. But we were in the playground, neighborhood friends, after school projects, after school swimming. A little bit of tablet on the weekends, but there was no internet access and there was no YouTube in my life, there was no Roblox, there was no gaming. So, a very different world.Parent 5.0: I have a similar experience to Parent 3. My high schooler had a lot of his homework that he had to type and word process... I don't know if that's the right word, into Docs, but it wasn't a huge amount. It wasn't doing research, it wasn't hours and hours. My elementary school guy, he didn't have any homework on the computer at all. And my middle schooler had very little, like type this one thing or something like that. It was very little on the computer. And for myself, in terms of my family, I lock the video games so that there was very little access to video games during the week.Parent 5.0: And then on the weekends there was an hour or something like that, it wasn't that much. There was no YouTube watching, like now YouTube consumes our life. My kids didn't even know how to use the features on our TV, the smart features, they didn't know they could access YouTube on it or anything like that. So it was very controlled and very little. I also had my children in a lot of afterschool activities. My older son was in an orchestra, he also was in a band, theater groups, there was a lot of afterschool activity. A lot of playing outside, a lot of going to the park and all that stuff. Yeah, so...Parent 4.0: I can go. My kids probably had more... It sounds like they did more online than, so far, the rest of them. But my daughter in high school definitely had almost all of her homework... Not all of it because she was assigned in school, but she definitely was on doing homework, I feel like, a good amount. Nothing like now, but definitely was using it. My middle schooler also, but not as much. They both did play games or use Instagram, my daughter was really into Instagram, not as much anymore but definitely games. Now it's just like a free-for-all. I mean, they're in their rooms with the door shut, I have no idea what they're doing all day. I just know that they're doing their homework, getting good grades. I think they're on electronics the entire day.Parent 1.0: Yeah, so I have a similar experience with my eight-year-old. Pre-pandemic he was still in second grade so the use of computers was very limited. Maybe once a week he would type, words of the week was one of the options I picked to do. That was his only interaction with computer. Of course he had devices to play on, and he would go to his father's house every other weekend and he would be more exposed there to computers. But still he was busy. He was busy during the week, there was school, there was getting to school, getting from school, that's a trip in itself.Parent 1.0: There was hockey, we had TaeKwonDo, he was very busy. Even then it didn't seem like enough, it didn't seem like we were doing enough but he was certainly a lot busier than now. And he did get to play, mostly probably on the weekends, and again, weekends were also pretty packed. So I don't know how he had time, but he did play, not a lot.

He was typing away, quickly was able to navigate where to go to sign into a Google classroom. So, that was impressive in the beginning, how quickly they were able to adapt to that. So yes... I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?  \n",
       "2  Moderator: How the technology has changed during the pandemic, school purposes and whether it's beneficial or problematic?Parent 1.0: Right, exactly, it seems beneficial because it is an important part of your life as you grow older in high school clearly, and in middle school as Parent 4 said, there's some use of computer. So at first it seemed like a good thing, and I'm sure it is a good thing, it's just, like I said, it's just become overwhelming use of technology because they sit in front of it all day. And another thing, this use of YouTube, because I understand teachers post some things that you can look up on YouTube, so you can't block YouTube because it'll be used as a tool for one of those classes they have.Parent 1.0: But YouTube is just this bottomless hole of... I can't even begin, it's just so bad. And transition from looking at your Google classroom or your Google meet and here's YouTube, it's just so easy. And we were not always there, we still have jobs and other things to do, can't just sit on top of them. So this accessibility of technology that has this type of content, like YouTube, that's not beneficial for kids, that's been problematic, to say the least.Parent 5.0: So for us, we only had a desktop and a laptop, which was more than sufficient pre-pandemic. And then everybody needed a device, all of a sudden everybody needed a device Needed to be on at basically the same times so we got one device from school, we bought a laptop, we found an old laptop. It was like the gathering of devices. And then teaching... My nine-year-old, teaching him how to use it, he really hadn't used computers in that way. And so teaching him how to use it. My middle son is prone to migraines and so being on the screen caused migraines and so that caused some aversion because he didn't want to be on.Parent 5.0: The schedules were kind of crazy, like all over the place. And the truth is that it's hard because my 17-year-old, who knew how to do all these things just kind of stayed in his room for months. And it was just... I feel bad saying it, but he was kind of left to his own devices. He wasn't a big social media guy, he has no social media still, but when the only way to communicate with his peers became to use... What is it? Discord, and all these other things, that became the only way to communicate with people. And then it almost, I feel like... Like Parent 1 said, it's like this black hole that sucks you in.Parent 5.0: And then there was also no schedule. Because we have some special needs in our family, my schedule is really tight with my kids and so the little guys we go to bed at 8:30 and then 9:00 and then the older one was in bed by 10:00 and there was a lot of structure, and literally it was like a bomb hit it. People were going to bed at 1:00 in the morning, it was just totally... It felt chaotic and out of control, and it felt like the technology sputtered for a little bit as we gt devices figured out how to get everybody on and then it was this black hole that sucked you in. And then everybody was on for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours, and it felt out of control.Parent 3.0: Sure, when lock down happened my then first grader, the school did a great job pivoting to remote quite quickly. They used seesaw as a platform. I did get two laptops from the DOE because we have a lot of tech but it's all very old and kind of fragile and I'm like, they're going to wreck it all. Nothings insured. We're self-employed and I could just see the whole business being wiped out so we did take a DOE iPads which was a lifesaver. But also, again, we got to one point where the computer teacher did that YouTube... We were not on the YouTube and she sent one link and they figured out, \"Oh, I can get to YouTube from this link.\"Parent 3.0: And then it was like a bomb went off, they figured it out, they figured out workarounds and it was like Pandora's box. I was trying to figure out how to block... I was on the phone with t...  \n",
       "3  Moderator: Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?Parent 4.0: Absolutely. If you want, I can finish that. Actually I'm having problems now because my sons school said... We requested, they didn't say it, but depending on the size of the class you might be able to go in one more day. You can only go one day a week now. And I was able to get him in two days. And the fit that I got, screaming at me for five days until that day came, it was horrible. About how [inaudible 00:33:53] the worst, making him go in for two days instead of just one, so I can only imagine what's going to happen next year.Parent 2.0: I'm sorry. My sons, they actually go to school five days out of the week. Initially we were blended and I had the same issues, the same issues with just constantly on YouTube, and constantly playing Roblox. When they were supposed to do their work I would go in and I would see them clicking out of the YouTube window. We received two laptops from the DOE as well, but before it was kind of limited because we had a desktop and we had a laptop. So before they had to take turns going on the computer if they were allowed to. They went on the computer but it was mainly on the weekends because they did play Roblox but not as often.Parent 2.0: But after everything shut down I didn't have much entertainment to do besides television or talking with your friends or Roblox or Discord or whatever. Yeah, it just consumed a lot of their time. My daughter, who is three, I couldn't send her to the babysitter anymore, so she was home with me while I was working from home so I would have to force her to look at YouTube too, or watch the television. So I kind of really felt bad because I had to do that so I try to always turn on something educational, like Sesame Street. But then she started telling me what she wanted to watch after a while, Nick Jr. or Netflix, so that became a problem.Parent 2.0: But even after my son started going back to school five days out of the week it still became a problem, technology, because right after they do their homework they will go on YouTube or they go on Roblox or something. I don't know what they're doing in the back. I have to tell them to go in the back because when they come home from school I still have to work so it still became a problem even though they're back in school five days out of the week. So yeah, and they still have some assignments on the computer, like homework assignments on the computer. Yeah, even if they go back to school I feel like it still would be a problem if you're having issues now with them remotely. So yeah, that's my experience.Parent 5.0: For me, the months that I tried to work from home with my three kids was nearly impossible, like I'm sure many other people. So out of desperation, in September we decided to put my middle schooler in a private school, so he has been going five days a week with some interruptions when they close school, but there hasn't been that many. Today, I guess I got word from the elementary school that they're moving to a five day week model, I guess in two weeks. But my son has been going for two days a week since October with the school closings and stuff. But he is happy to go. He's looking forward to go. And my high schooler has also been going blended, it's interesting because sometimes...Parent 5.0: Yes, I am. This is exactly what happened all throughout the pandemic.Parent 5.0: And my high schooler, I think it's interesting because even if he's the only one, which has happened several times, he goes when he supposed to go. I was like, \"You're going to keep going?\" And he's like, \"Yeah, I'm going to go.\" And I'm like, \"Okay.\" So I personally don't anticipate any issues. He's graduating, I think that's also part of it, because I think they missed out on their whole senior year and everything that they were looking forward to so just being able to go and see teachers and stuff like that,...  \n",
       "4  Moderator: Any positive parts you would like to see continue, or are there parts that you're really hoping would end as we go back?Parent 3.0: The Google Classrooms, since my daughter has very little executive functioning, she has social anxiety and ADHD, just being able to use the chat function since she'll never raise her hand and she'll never ask for help. Using Google Classroom to directly reach out to the teacher and use the chat function has been fantastic. And then when she goes in blended she has more direct contact with the teacher. She goes in twice or three times a week with her cohort. So I like the Google Classroom set up for her as a sixth grader. Also, the smaller cohorts have been great. It's going to be, just to answer the other question, odd when it goes back to 32 kids. But I love that she can send a quick message, she gets a quick response back, and so that communication has really helped her a lot as an introvert and having those issues.Parent 4.0: Yeah, same thing with Google Classroom. It's probably recent, in the past month or two maybe, that we get a daily update at the end of the day for my middle schooler. I at least see what he's doing, which is probably more than what I ever got from him or the school, definitely from the school, before. So, that's nice to at least get a daily rundown of... It might only be a sentence or two each, but it's at least Something. So, that's nice. And I also like that they do get immediate responses basically from teachers if they have questions on homework or questions... Whatever it might be, but everyone is pretty receptive to responding in a quick time period.Parent 1.0: So my son, Google Classroom, it was not a good experience because he would not put his camera on, he would just hide behind his camera. He would not participate. He did not reach out in the G chat message or whatever. So that part has not been working out for us very well. However, someone had an idea that I overheard, and so I found a tutor, just another teacher from another school who does tutoring. And so the ability to have tutoring at your fingertips without having to commute or travel, or go and wait and sit there in the car has been... And not just that, but the ability to one on one connects like this.Parent 1.0: So the one teacher, who is... and not in a very formal way like his teacher, in a less formal way. So that's been amazing. So the feedback that I get from his two tutors that he has... And we haven't been doing it for a long time, maybe a month or so, maybe over a month, has been been great. Overall very positive. So I'm very happy because he did need help in ELA and math and was complete lack of participation in his Google Classroom. I didn't even know what he knew and what he learned any more this past year. So the one on one ability without having to go anywhere, get dressed, drive, so that was a great deal and I hope that will stay. And I hope it will stay because, why not? There's a demand and there's a supply, I think that would be one good takeaway, some remote learning options.Parent 2.0: The only thing I probably would miss about using technology is the communication with the schools and the teachers. It was easier to communicate–Parent 2.0: Yes, having direct contact with the teachers and the schools ,instead of the school sending a bunch of print outs with the children in folders, that became overwhelming, all the paper. The teachers, they were able to reach out to me immediately. I mean, not that they weren't doing that before, but I think it became easier to do because it just became that platform that everyone was using. I believe my school, they use Class Dojo as a way to communicate. I think the platform that they used for the students in the school work was iLearn and I didn't really like it so I'm kind of glad...Parent 2.0: I mean, now that they're going to school five days a week they don't need to use that. I think only the children who are remote use it, but...  "

       "      <td>Moderator: So just starting to think through some of the impact of technology, can we talk a little bit about how your child used technology prior to the pandemic for school purposes? Parent 2.0: Oh okay. Well, they didn't use it as much. I mean, the teachers would assign some reading or math assignments on I ready and from time to time some homework. But yeah, that was about it. I would monitor how much time they were on Roblox and other things to entertain themselves, but it was easier control them back then because they didn't have to go on as much. I mean, that's what it was. Parent 3.0: I would say the same thing. My daughter was in fifth grade, we would have a couple in Newsela projects, half an hour of homework. But we were in the playground, neighborhood friends, after school projects, after school swimming. A little bit of tablet on the weekends, but there was no internet access and there was no YouTube in my life, there was no Roblox, there was no gaming. So, a very different world. Parent 5.0: I have a similar experience to Parent 3. My high schooler had a lot of his homework that he had to type and word process... I don't know if that's the right word, into Docs, but it wasn't a huge amount. It wasn't doing research, it wasn't hours and hours. My elementary school guy, he didn't have any homework on the computer at all. And my middle schooler had very little, like type this one thing or something like that. It was very little on the computer. And for myself, in terms of my family, I lock the video games so that there was very little access to video games during the week. Parent 5.0: And then on the weekends there was an hour or something like that, it wasn't that much. There was no YouTube watching, like now YouTube consumes our life. My kids didn't even know how to use the features on our TV, the smart features, they didn't know they could access YouTube on it or anything like that. So it was very controlled and very little. I also had my children in a lot of afterschool activities. My older son was in an orchestra, he also was in a band, theater groups, there was a lot of afterschool activity. A lot of playing outside, a lot of going to the park and all that stuff. Yeah, so... Parent 4.0: I can go. My kids probably had more... It sounds like they did more online than, so far, the rest of them. But my daughter in high school definitely had almost all of her homework... Not all of it because she was assigned in school, but she definitely was on doing homework, I feel like, a good amount. Nothing like now, but definitely was using it. My middle schooler also, but not as much. They both did play games or use Instagram, my daughter was really into Instagram, not as much anymore but definitely games. Now it's just like a free-for-all. I mean, they're in their rooms with the door shut, I have no idea what they're doing all day. I just know that they're doing their homework, getting good grades. I think they're on electronics the entire day. Parent 1.0: Yeah, so I have a similar experience with my eight-year-old. Pre-pandemic he was still in second grade so the use of computers was very limited. Maybe once a week he would type, words of the week was one of the options I picked to do. That was his only interaction with computer. Of course he had devices to play on, and he would go to his father's house every other weekend and he would be more exposed there to computers. But still he was busy. He was busy during the week, there was school, there was getting to school, getting from school, that's a trip in itself. Parent 1.0: There was hockey, we had TaeKwonDo, he was very busy. Even then it didn't seem like enough, it didn't seem like we were doing enough but he was certainly a lot busier than now. And he did get to play, mostly probably on the weekends, and again, weekends were also pretty packed. So I don't know how he had time, but he did play, not a lot. And of course we were able to control it, it was an item you ...</td>\n",

Parent 1.0: I can say for my eight-year-old, because again, we went from not really knowing how to use a computer or how to type, to transition really smoothly, I mean if you can call that a benefit, we transitioned really quickly. He was typing away, quickly was able to navigate where to go to sign into a Google classroom. So, that was impressive in the beginning, how quickly they were able to adapt to that. So yes... I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Moderator: How the technology has changed during the pandemic, school purposes and whether it's beneficial or problematic? Parent 1.0: Right, exactly, it seems beneficial because it is an important part of your life as you grow older in high school clearly, and in middle school as Parent 4 said, there's some use of computer. So at first it seemed like a good thing, and I'm sure it is a good thing, it's just, like I said, it's just become overwhelming use of technology because they sit in front of it all day. And another thing, this use of YouTube, because I understand teachers post some things that you can look up on YouTube, so you can't block YouTube because it'll be used as a tool for one of those classes they have. Parent 1.0: But YouTube is just this bottomless hole of... I can't even begin, it's just so bad. And transition from looking at your Google classroom or your Google meet and here's YouTube, it's just so easy. And we were not always there, we still have jobs and other things to do, can't just sit on top of them. So this accessibility of technology that has this type of content, like YouTube, that's not beneficial for kids, that's been problematic, to say the least. Parent 5.0: So for us, we only had a desktop and a laptop, which was more than sufficient pre-pandemic. And then everybody needed a device, all of a sudden everybody needed a device Needed to be on at basically the same times so we got one device from school, we bought a laptop, we found an old laptop. It was like the gathering of devices. And then teaching... My nine-year-old, teaching him how to use it, he really hadn't used computers in that way. And so teaching him how to use it. My middle son is prone to migraines and so being on the screen caused migraines and so that caused some aversion because he didn't want to be on. Parent 5.0: The schedules were kind of crazy, like all over the place. And the truth is that it's hard because my 17-year-old, who knew how to do all these things just kind of stayed in his room for months. And it was just... I feel bad saying it, but he was kind of left to his own devices. He wasn't a big social media guy, he has no social media still, but when the only way to communicate with his peers became to use... What is it? Discord, and all these other things, that became the only way to communicate with people. And then it almost, I feel like... Like Parent 1 said, it's like this black hole that sucks you in. Parent 5.0: And then there was also no schedule. Because we have some special needs in our family, my schedule is really tight with my kids and so the little guys we go to bed at 8:30 and then 9:00 and then the older one was in bed by 10:00 and there was a lot of structure, and literally it was like a bomb hit it. People were going to bed at 1:00 in the morning, it was just totally... It felt chaotic and out of control, and it felt like the technology sputtered for a little bit as we gt devices figured out how to get everybody on and then it was this black hole that sucked you in. And then everybody was on for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours, and it felt out of control. Parent 3.0: Sure, when lock down happened my then first grader, the school did a great job pivoting to remote quite quickly. They used seesaw as a platform. I did get two laptops from the DOE because we have a lot of tech but it's all very old and kind of fragile and I'm like, they're going to wreck it all. Nothings insured. We're self-employed and I could just see the whole business being wiped out so we did take a DOE iPads which was a lifesaver. But also, again, we got to one point where the computer teacher did that YouTube... We were not on the YouTube and she sent one link and they figured out, \"Oh, I can get to YouTube from this link.\" Parent 3.0: And then it was like a bomb went off, they figured it out, they figured out workarounds and it was like Pandora's box. I was trying to figure out how to block... I was on the phone...</td>\n",

       "      <td>Moderator: Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time? Parent 4.0: Absolutely. If you want, I can finish that. Actually I'm having problems now because my sons school said... We requested, they didn't say it, but depending on the size of the class you might be able to go in one more day. You can only go one day a week now. And I was able to get him in two days. And the fit that I got, screaming at me for five days until that day came, it was horrible. About how [inaudible 00:33:53] the worst, making him go in for two days instead of just one, so I can only imagine what's going to happen next year. Parent 2.0: I'm sorry. My sons, they actually go to school five days out of the week. Initially we were blended and I had the same issues, the same issues with just constantly on YouTube, and constantly playing Roblox. When they were supposed to do their work I would go in and I would see them clicking out of the YouTube window. We received two laptops from the DOE as well, but before it was kind of limited because we had a desktop and we had a laptop. So before they had to take turns going on the computer if they were allowed to. They went on the computer but it was mainly on the weekends because they did play Roblox but not as often. Parent 2.0: But after everything shut down I didn't have much entertainment to do besides television or talking with your friends or Roblox or Discord or whatever. Yeah, it just consumed a lot of their time. My daughter, who is three, I couldn't send her to the babysitter anymore, so she was home with me while I was working from home so I would have to force her to look at YouTube too, or watch the television. So I kind of really felt bad because I had to do that so I try to always turn on something educational, like Sesame Street. But then she started telling me what she wanted to watch after a while, Nick Jr. or Netflix, so that became a problem. Parent 2.0: But even after my son started going back to school five days out of the week it still became a problem, technology, because right after they do their homework they will go on YouTube or they go on Roblox or something. I don't know what they're doing in the back. I have to tell them to go in the back because when they come home from school I still have to work so it still became a problem even though they're back in school five days out of the week. So yeah, and they still have some assignments on the computer, like homework assignments on the computer. Yeah, even if they go back to school I feel like it still would be a problem if you're having issues now with them remotely. So yeah, that's my experience. Parent 5.0: For me, the months that I tried to work from home with my three kids was nearly impossible, like I'm sure many other people. So out of desperation, in September we decided to put my middle schooler in a private school, so he has been going five days a week with some interruptions when they close school, but there hasn't been that many. Today, I guess I got word from the elementary school that they're moving to a five day week model, I guess in two weeks. But my son has been going for two days a week since October with the school closings and stuff. But he is happy to go. He's looking forward to go. And my high schooler has also been going blended, it's interesting because sometimes... Parent 5.0: Yes, I am. This is exactly what happened all throughout the pandemic. Parent 5.0: And my high schooler, I think it's interesting because even if he's the only one, which has happened several times, he goes when he supposed to go. I was like, \"You're going to keep going?\" And he's like, \"Yeah, I'm going to go.\" And I'm like, \"Okay.\" So I personally don't anticipate any issues. He's graduating, I think that's also part of it, because I think they missed out on their whole senior year and everything that they were looking forward to so just being able to go and see teachers and stuff lik...</td>\n",

       "      <td>Moderator: Any positive parts you would like to see continue, or are there parts that you're really hoping would end as we go back? Parent 3.0: The Google Classrooms, since my daughter has very little executive functioning, she has social anxiety and ADHD, just being able to use the chat function since she'll never raise her hand and she'll never ask for help. Using Google Classroom to directly reach out to the teacher and use the chat function has been fantastic. And then when she goes in blended she has more direct contact with the teacher. She goes in twice or three times a week with her cohort. So I like the Google Classroom set up for her as a sixth grader. Also, the smaller cohorts have been great. It's going to be, just to answer the other question, odd when it goes back to 32 kids. But I love that she can send a quick message, she gets a quick response back, and so that communication has really helped her a lot as an introvert and having those issues. Parent 4.0: Yeah, same thing with Google Classroom. It's probably recent, in the past month or two maybe, that we get a daily update at the end of the day for my middle schooler. I at least see what he's doing, which is probably more than what I ever got from him or the school, definitely from the school, before. So, that's nice to at least get a daily rundown of... It might only be a sentence or two each, but it's at least Something. So, that's nice. And I also like that they do get immediate responses basically from teachers if they have questions on homework or questions... Whatever it might be, but everyone is pretty receptive to responding in a quick time period. Parent 1.0: So my son, Google Classroom, it was not a good experience because he would not put his camera on, he would just hide behind his camera. He would not participate. He did not reach out in the G chat message or whatever. So that part has not been working out for us very well. However, someone had an idea that I overheard, and so I found a tutor, just another teacher from another school who does tutoring. And so the ability to have tutoring at your fingertips without having to commute or travel, or go and wait and sit there in the car has been... And not just that, but the ability to one on one connects like this. Parent 1.0: So the one teacher, who is... and not in a very formal way like his teacher, in a less formal way. So that's been amazing. So the feedback that I get from his two tutors that he has... And we haven't been doing it for a long time, maybe a month or so, maybe over a month, has been been great. Overall very positive. So I'm very happy because he did need help in ELA and math and was complete lack of participation in his Google Classroom. I didn't even know what he knew and what he learned any more this past year. So the one on one ability without having to go anywhere, get dressed, drive, so that was a great deal and I hope that will stay. And I hope it will stay because, why not? There's a demand and there's a supply, I think that would be one good takeaway, some remote learning options. Parent 2.0: The only thing I probably would miss about using technology is the communication with the schools and the teachers. It was easier to communicate– Parent 2.0: Yes, having direct contact with the teachers and the schools ,instead of the school sending a bunch of print outs with the children in folders, that became overwhelming, all the paper. The teachers, they were able to reach out to me immediately. I mean, not that they weren't doing that before, but I think it became easier to do because it just became that platform that everyone was using. I believe my school, they use Class Dojo as a way to communicate. I think the platform that they used for the students in the school work was iLearn and I didn't really like it so I'm kind of glad... Parent 2.0: I mean, now that they're going to school five days a week they don't need to use that. I think only the children who are remote use ...</td>\n",

       "0  Moderator: So just starting to think through some of the impact of technology, can we talk a little bit about how your child used technology prior to the pandemic for school purposes? Parent 2.0: Oh okay. Well, they didn't use it as much. I mean, the teachers would assign some reading or math assignments on I ready and from time to time some homework. But yeah, that was about it. I would monitor how much time they were on Roblox and other things to entertain themselves, but it was easier control them back then because they didn't have to go on as much. I mean, that's what it was. Parent 3.0: I would say the same thing. My daughter was in fifth grade, we would have a couple in Newsela projects, half an hour of homework. But we were in the playground, neighborhood friends, after school projects, after school swimming. A little bit of tablet on the weekends, but there was no internet access and there was no YouTube in my life, there was no Roblox, there was no gaming. So, a very different world. Parent 5.0: I have a similar experience to Parent 3. My high schooler had a lot of his homework that he had to type and word process... I don't know if that's the right word, into Docs, but it wasn't a huge amount. It wasn't doing research, it wasn't hours and hours. My elementary school guy, he didn't have any homework on the computer at all. And my middle schooler had very little, like type this one thing or something like that. It was very little on the computer. And for myself, in terms of my family, I lock the video games so that there was very little access to video games during the week. Parent 5.0: And then on the weekends there was an hour or something like that, it wasn't that much. There was no YouTube watching, like now YouTube consumes our life. My kids didn't even know how to use the features on our TV, the smart features, they didn't know they could access YouTube on it or anything like that. So it was very controlled and very little. I also had my children in a lot of afterschool activities. My older son was in an orchestra, he also was in a band, theater groups, there was a lot of afterschool activity. A lot of playing outside, a lot of going to the park and all that stuff. Yeah, so... Parent 4.0: I can go. My kids probably had more... It sounds like they did more online than, so far, the rest of them. But my daughter in high school definitely had almost all of her homework... Not all of it because she was assigned in school, but she definitely was on doing homework, I feel like, a good amount. Nothing like now, but definitely was using it. My middle schooler also, but not as much. They both did play games or use Instagram, my daughter was really into Instagram, not as much anymore but definitely games. Now it's just like a free-for-all. I mean, they're in their rooms with the door shut, I have no idea what they're doing all day. I just know that they're doing their homework, getting good grades. I think they're on electronics the entire day. Parent 1.0: Yeah, so I have a similar experience with my eight-year-old. Pre-pandemic he was still in second grade so the use of computers was very limited. Maybe once a week he would type, words of the week was one of the options I picked to do. That was his only interaction with computer. Of course he had devices to play on, and he would go to his father's house every other weekend and he would be more exposed there to computers. But still he was busy. He was busy during the week, there was school, there was getting to school, getting from school, that's a trip in itself. Parent 1.0: There was hockey, we had TaeKwonDo, he was very busy. Even then it didn't seem like enough, it didn't seem like we were doing enough but he was certainly a lot busier than now.

Parent 1.0: I can say for my eight-year-old, because again, we went from not really knowing how to use a computer or how to type, to transition really smoothly, I mean if you can call that a benefit, we transitioned really quickly. He was typing away, quickly was able to navigate where to go to sign into a Google classroom. So, that was impressive in the beginning, how quickly they were able to adapt to that. So yes... I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?  \n",
       "2  Moderator: How the technology has changed during the pandemic, school purposes and whether it's beneficial or problematic? Parent 1.0: Right, exactly, it seems beneficial because it is an important part of your life as you grow older in high school clearly, and in middle school as Parent 4 said, there's some use of computer. So at first it seemed like a good thing, and I'm sure it is a good thing, it's just, like I said, it's just become overwhelming use of technology because they sit in front of it all day. And another thing, this use of YouTube, because I understand teachers post some things that you can look up on YouTube, so you can't block YouTube because it'll be used as a tool for one of those classes they have. Parent 1.0: But YouTube is just this bottomless hole of... I can't even begin, it's just so bad. And transition from looking at your Google classroom or your Google meet and here's YouTube, it's just so easy. And we were not always there, we still have jobs and other things to do, can't just sit on top of them. So this accessibility of technology that has this type of content, like YouTube, that's not beneficial for kids, that's been problematic, to say the least. Parent 5.0: So for us, we only had a desktop and a laptop, which was more than sufficient pre-pandemic. And then everybody needed a device, all of a sudden everybody needed a device Needed to be on at basically the same times so we got one device from school, we bought a laptop, we found an old laptop. It was like the gathering of devices. And then teaching... My nine-year-old, teaching him how to use it, he really hadn't used computers in that way. And so teaching him how to use it. My middle son is prone to migraines and so being on the screen caused migraines and so that caused some aversion because he didn't want to be on. Parent 5.0: The schedules were kind of crazy, like all over the place. And the truth is that it's hard because my 17-year-old, who knew how to do all these things just kind of stayed in his room for months. And it was just... I feel bad saying it, but he was kind of left to his own devices. He wasn't a big social media guy, he has no social media still, but when the only way to communicate with his peers became to use... What is it? Discord, and all these other things, that became the only way to communicate with people. And then it almost, I feel like... Like Parent 1 said, it's like this black hole that sucks you in. Parent 5.0: And then there was also no schedule. Because we have some special needs in our family, my schedule is really tight with my kids and so the little guys we go to bed at 8:30 and then 9:00 and then the older one was in bed by 10:00 and there was a lot of structure, and literally it was like a bomb hit it. People were going to bed at 1:00 in the morning, it was just totally... It felt chaotic and out of control, and it felt like the technology sputtered for a little bit as we gt devices figured out how to get everybody on and then it was this black hole that sucked you in. And then everybody was on for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours, and it felt out of control. Parent 3.0: Sure, when lock down happened my then first grader, the school did a great job pivoting to remote quite quickly. They used seesaw as a platform. I did get two laptops from the DOE because we have a lot of tech but it's all very old and kind of fragile and I'm like, they're going to wreck it all. Nothings insured. We're self-employed and I could just see the whole business being wiped out so we did take a DOE iPads which was a lifesaver. But also, again, we got to one point where the computer teacher did that YouTube... We were not on the YouTube and she sent one link and they figured out, \"Oh, I can get to YouTube from this link.\" Parent 3.0: And then it was like a bomb went off, they figured it out, they figured out workarounds and it was like Pandora's box. I was trying to figure out how to block... I was on the phone...  \n",
       "3  Moderator: Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time? Parent 4.0: Absolutely. If you want, I can finish that. Actually I'm having problems now because my sons school said... We requested, they didn't say it, but depending on the size of the class you might be able to go in one more day. You can only go one day a week now. And I was able to get him in two days. And the fit that I got, screaming at me for five days until that day came, it was horrible. About how [inaudible 00:33:53] the worst, making him go in for two days instead of just one, so I can only imagine what's going to happen next year. Parent 2.0: I'm sorry. My sons, they actually go to school five days out of the week. Initially we were blended and I had the same issues, the same issues with just constantly on YouTube, and constantly playing Roblox. When they were supposed to do their work I would go in and I would see them clicking out of the YouTube window. We received two laptops from the DOE as well, but before it was kind of limited because we had a desktop and we had a laptop. So before they had to take turns going on the computer if they were allowed to. They went on the computer but it was mainly on the weekends because they did play Roblox but not as often. Parent 2.0: But after everything shut down I didn't have much entertainment to do besides television or talking with your friends or Roblox or Discord or whatever. Yeah, it just consumed a lot of their time. My daughter, who is three, I couldn't send her to the babysitter anymore, so she was home with me while I was working from home so I would have to force her to look at YouTube too, or watch the television. So I kind of really felt bad because I had to do that so I try to always turn on something educational, like Sesame Street. But then she started telling me what she wanted to watch after a while, Nick Jr. or Netflix, so that became a problem. Parent 2.0: But even after my son started going back to school five days out of the week it still became a problem, technology, because right after they do their homework they will go on YouTube or they go on Roblox or something. I don't know what they're doing in the back. I have to tell them to go in the back because when they come home from school I still have to work so it still became a problem even though they're back in school five days out of the week. So yeah, and they still have some assignments on the computer, like homework assignments on the computer. Yeah, even if they go back to school I feel like it still would be a problem if you're having issues now with them remotely. So yeah, that's my experience. Parent 5.0: For me, the months that I tried to work from home with my three kids was nearly impossible, like I'm sure many other people. So out of desperation, in September we decided to put my middle schooler in a private school, so he has been going five days a week with some interruptions when they close school, but there hasn't been that many. Today, I guess I got word from the elementary school that they're moving to a five day week model, I guess in two weeks. But my son has been going for two days a week since October with the school closings and stuff. But he is happy to go. He's looking forward to go. And my high schooler has also been going blended, it's interesting because sometimes... Parent 5.0: Yes, I am. This is exactly what happened all throughout the pandemic. Parent 5.0: And my high schooler, I think it's interesting because even if he's the only one, which has happened several times, he goes when he supposed to go. I was like, \"You're going to keep going?\" And he's like, \"Yeah, I'm going to go.\" And I'm like, \"Okay.\" So I personally don't anticipate any issues. He's graduating, I think that's also part of it, because I think they missed out on their whole senior year and everything that they were looking forward to so just being able to go and see teachers and stuff lik...  \n",
       "4  Moderator: Any positive parts you would like to see continue, or are there parts that you're really hoping would end as we go back? Parent 3.0: The Google Classrooms, since my daughter has very little executive functioning, she has social anxiety and ADHD, just being able to use the chat function since she'll never raise her hand and she'll never ask for help. Using Google Classroom to directly reach out to the teacher and use the chat function has been fantastic. And then when she goes in blended she has more direct contact with the teacher. She goes in twice or three times a week with her cohort. So I like the Google Classroom set up for her as a sixth grader. Also, the smaller cohorts have been great. It's going to be, just to answer the other question, odd when it goes back to 32 kids. But I love that she can send a quick message, she gets a quick response back, and so that communication has really helped her a lot as an introvert and having those issues. Parent 4.0: Yeah, same thing with Google Classroom. It's probably recent, in the past month or two maybe, that we get a daily update at the end of the day for my middle schooler. I at least see what he's doing, which is probably more than what I ever got from him or the school, definitely from the school, before. So, that's nice to at least get a daily rundown of... It might only be a sentence or two each, but it's at least Something. So, that's nice. And I also like that they do get immediate responses basically from teachers if they have questions on homework or questions... Whatever it might be, but everyone is pretty receptive to responding in a quick time period. Parent 1.0: So my son, Google Classroom, it was not a good experience because he would not put his camera on, he would just hide behind his camera. He would not participate. He did not reach out in the G chat message or whatever. So that part has not been working out for us very well. However, someone had an idea that I overheard, and so I found a tutor, just another teacher from another school who does tutoring. And so the ability to have tutoring at your fingertips without having to commute or travel, or go and wait and sit there in the car has been... And not just that, but the ability to one on one connects like this. Parent 1.0: So the one teacher, who is... and not in a very formal way like his teacher, in a less formal way. So that's been amazing. So the feedback that I get from his two tutors that he has... And we haven't been doing it for a long time, maybe a month or so, maybe over a month, has been been great. Overall very positive. So I'm very happy because he did need help in ELA and math and was complete lack of participation in his Google Classroom. I didn't even know what he knew and what he learned any more this past year. So the one on one ability without having to go anywhere, get dressed, drive, so that was a great deal and I hope that will stay. And I hope it will stay because, why not? There's a demand and there's a supply, I think that would be one good takeaway, some remote learning options. Parent 2.0: The only thing I probably would miss about using technology is the communication with the schools and the teachers. It was easier to communicate– Parent 2.0: Yes, having direct contact with the teachers and the schools ,instead of the school sending a bunch of print outs with the children in folders, that became overwhelming, all the paper. The teachers, they were able to reach out to me immediately. I mean, not that they weren't doing that before, but I think it became easier to do because it just became that platform that everyone was using. I believe my school, they use Class Dojo as a way to communicate. I think the platform that they used for the students in the school work was iLearn and I didn't really like it so I'm kind of glad... Parent 2.0: I mean, now that they're going to school five days a week they don't need to use that. I think only the children who are remote use ...  "

Well, they didn't use it as much. I mean, the teachers would assign some reading or math assignments on I ready and from time to time some homework. But yeah, that was about it. I would monitor how much time they were on Roblox and other things to entertain themselves, but it was easier control them back then because they didn't have to go on as much. I mean, that's what it was.Parent 3.0: I would say the same thing. My daughter was in fifth grade, we would have a couple in Newsela projects, half an hour of homework. But we were in the playground, neighborhood friends, after school projects, after school swimming. A little bit of tablet on the weekends, but there was no internet access and there was no YouTube in my life, there was no Roblox, there was no gaming. So, a very different world.Parent 5.0: I have a similar experience to Parent 3. My high schooler had a lot of his homework that he had to type and word process... I don't know if that's the right word, into Docs, but it wasn't a huge amount. It wasn't doing research, it wasn't hours and hours. My elementary school guy, he didn't have any homework on the computer at all. And my middle schooler had very little, like type this one thing or something like that. It was very little on the computer. And for myself, in terms of my family, I lock the video games so that there was very little access to video games during the week.Parent 5.0: And then on the weekends there was an hour or something like that, it wasn't that much. There was no YouTube watching, like now YouTube consumes our life. My kids didn't even know how to use the features on our TV, the smart features, they didn't know they could access YouTube on it or anything like that. So it was very controlled and very little. I also had my children in a lot of afterschool activities. My older son was in an orchestra, he also was in a band, theater groups, there was a lot of afterschool activity. A lot of playing outside, a lot of going to the park and all that stuff. Yeah, so...Parent 4.0: I can go. My kids probably had more... It sounds like they did more online than, so far, the rest of them. But my daughter in high school definitely had almost all of her homework... Not all of it because she was assigned in school, but she definitely was on doing homework, I feel like, a good amount. Nothing like now, but definitely was using it. My middle schooler also, but not as much. They both did play games or use Instagram, my daughter was really into Instagram, not as much anymore but definitely games. Now it's just like a free-for-all. I mean, they're in their rooms with the door shut, I have no idea what they're doing all day. I just know that they're doing their homework, getting good grades. I think they're on electronics the entire day.Parent 1.0: Yeah, so I have a similar experience with my eight-year-old. Pre-pandemic he was still in second grade so the use of computers was very limited. Maybe once a week he would type, words of the week was one of the options I picked to do. That was his only interaction with computer. Of course he had devices to play on, and he would go to his father's house every other weekend and he would be more exposed there to computers. But still he was busy. He was busy during the week, there was school, there was getting to school, getting from school, that's a trip in itself.Parent 1.0: There was hockey, we had TaeKwonDo, he was very busy. Even then it didn't seem like enough, it didn't seem like we were doing enough but he was certainly a lot busier than now. And he did get to play, mostly probably on the weekends, and again, weekends were also pretty packed. So I don't know how he had time, but he did play, not a lot. And of course we were able to control it, it was an item you had to ...</td>\n",

       "      <td>Moderator: How the technology has changed during the pandemic, school purposes and whether it's beneficial or problematic?Parent 1.0: Right, exactly, it seems beneficial because it is an important part of your life as you grow older in high school clearly, and in middle school as Parent 4 said, there's some use of computer. So at first it seemed like a good thing, and I'm sure it is a good thing, it's just, like I said, it's just become overwhelming use of technology because they sit in front of it all day. And another thing, this use of YouTube, because I understand teachers post some things that you can look up on YouTube, so you can't block YouTube because it'll be used as a tool for one of those classes they have.Parent 1.0: But YouTube is just this bottomless hole of... I can't even begin, it's just so bad. And transition from looking at your Google classroom or your Google meet and here's YouTube, it's just so easy. And we were not always there, we still have jobs and other things to do, can't just sit on top of them. So this accessibility of technology that has this type of content, like YouTube, that's not beneficial for kids, that's been problematic, to say the least.Parent 5.0: So for us, we only had a desktop and a laptop, which was more than sufficient pre-pandemic. And then everybody needed a device, all of a sudden everybody needed a device Needed to be on at basically the same times so we got one device from school, we bought a laptop, we found an old laptop. It was like the gathering of devices. And then teaching... My nine-year-old, teaching him how to use it, he really hadn't used computers in that way. And so teaching him how to use it. My middle son is prone to migraines and so being on the screen caused migraines and so that caused some aversion because he didn't want to be on.Parent 5.0: The schedules were kind of crazy, like all over the place. And the truth is that it's hard because my 17-year-old, who knew how to do all these things just kind of stayed in his room for months. And it was just... I feel bad saying it, but he was kind of left to his own devices. He wasn't a big social media guy, he has no social media still, but when the only way to communicate with his peers became to use... What is it? Discord, and all these other things, that became the only way to communicate with people. And then it almost, I feel like... Like Parent 1 said, it's like this black hole that sucks you in.Parent 5.0: And then there was also no schedule. Because we have some special needs in our family, my schedule is really tight with my kids and so the little guys we go to bed at 8:30 and then 9:00 and then the older one was in bed by 10:00 and there was a lot of structure, and literally it was like a bomb hit it. People were going to bed at 1:00 in the morning, it was just totally... It felt chaotic and out of control, and it felt like the technology sputtered for a little bit as we gt devices figured out how to get everybody on and then it was this black hole that sucked you in. And then everybody was on for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours, and it felt out of control.Parent 3.0: Sure, when lock down happened my then first grader, the school did a great job pivoting to remote quite quickly. They used seesaw as a platform. I did get two laptops from the DOE because we have a lot of tech but it's all very old and kind of fragile and I'm like, they're going to wreck it all. Nothings insured. We're self-employed and I could just see the whole business being wiped out so we did take a DOE iPads which was a lifesaver. But also, again, we got to one point where the computer teacher did that YouTube... We were not on the YouTube and she sent one link and they figured out, \"Oh, I can get to YouTube from this link.\"Parent 3.0: And then it was like a bomb went off, they figured it out, they figured out workarounds and it was like Pandora's box.

A month later I exchange the iPad but I nearly ripped my own hair out over this YouTube. Like I said, both my kids are on it all day. And I'm like, I don't understand, it's a school day.</td>\n",

Actually I'm having problems now because my sons school said... We requested, they didn't say it, but depending on the size of the class you might be able to go in one more day. You can only go one day a week now. And I was able to get him in two days. And the fit that I got, screaming at me for five days until that day came, it was horrible. About how [inaudible 00:33:53] the worst, making him go in for two days instead of just one, so I can only imagine what's going to happen next year.Parent 2.0: I'm sorry. My sons, they actually go to school five days out of the week. Initially we were blended and I had the same issues, the same issues with just constantly on YouTube, and constantly playing Roblox. When they were supposed to do their work I would go in and I would see them clicking out of the YouTube window. We received two laptops from the DOE as well, but before it was kind of limited because we had a desktop and we had a laptop. So before they had to take turns going on the computer if they were allowed to. They went on the computer but it was mainly on the weekends because they did play Roblox but not as often.Parent 2.0: But after everything shut down I didn't have much entertainment to do besides television or talking with your friends or Roblox or Discord or whatever. Yeah, it just consumed a lot of their time. My daughter, who is three, I couldn't send her to the babysitter anymore, so she was home with me while I was working from home so I would have to force her to look at YouTube too, or watch the television. So I kind of really felt bad because I had to do that so I try to always turn on something educational, like Sesame Street. But then she started telling me what she wanted to watch after a while, Nick Jr. or Netflix, so that became a problem.Parent 2.0: But even after my son started going back to school five days out of the week it still became a problem, technology, because right after they do their homework they will go on YouTube or they go on Roblox or something. I don't know what they're doing in the back. I have to tell them to go in the back because when they come home from school I still have to work so it still became a problem even though they're back in school five days out of the week. So yeah, and they still have some assignments on the computer, like homework assignments on the computer. Yeah, even if they go back to school I feel like it still would be a problem if you're having issues now with them remotely. So yeah, that's my experience.Parent 5.0: For me, the months that I tried to work from home with my three kids was nearly impossible, like I'm sure many other people. So out of desperation, in September we decided to put my middle schooler in a private school, so he has been going five days a week with some interruptions when they close school, but there hasn't been that many. Today, I guess I got word from the elementary school that they're moving to a five day week model, I guess in two weeks. But my son has been going for two days a week since October with the school closings and stuff. But he is happy to go. He's looking forward to go. And my high schooler has also been going blended, it's interesting because sometimes...Parent 5.0: Yes, I am. This is exactly what happened all throughout the pandemic.Parent 5.0: And my high schooler, I think it's interesting because even if he's the only one, which has happened several times, he goes when he supposed to go. I was like, \"You're going to keep going?\" And he's like, \"Yeah, I'm going to go.\" And I'm like, \"Okay.\" So I personally don't anticipate any issues. He's graduating, I think that's also part of it, because I think they missed out on their whole senior year and everything that they were looking forward to so just being able to go and see teachers and stuff like that,...</td>\n",

Using Google Classroom to directly reach out to the teacher and use the chat function has been fantastic. And then when she goes in blended she has more direct contact with the teacher. She goes in twice or three times a week with her cohort. So I like the Google Classroom set up for her as a sixth grader. Also, the smaller cohorts have been great. It's going to be, just to answer the other question, odd when it goes back to 32 kids. But I love that she can send a quick message, she gets a quick response back, and so that communication has really helped her a lot as an introvert and having those issues.Parent 4.0: Yeah, same thing with Google Classroom. It's probably recent, in the past month or two maybe, that we get a daily update at the end of the day for my middle schooler. I at least see what he's doing, which is probably more than what I ever got from him or the school, definitely from the school, before. So, that's nice to at least get a daily rundown of... It might only be a sentence or two each, but it's at least Something. So, that's nice. And I also like that they do get immediate responses basically from teachers if they have questions on homework or questions... Whatever it might be, but everyone is pretty receptive to responding in a quick time period.Parent 1.0: So my son, Google Classroom, it was not a good experience because he would not put his camera on, he would just hide behind his camera. He would not participate. He did not reach out in the G chat message or whatever. So that part has not been working out for us very well. However, someone had an idea that I overheard, and so I found a tutor, just another teacher from another school who does tutoring. And so the ability to have tutoring at your fingertips without having to commute or travel, or go and wait and sit there in the car has been... And not just that, but the ability to one on one connects like this.Parent 1.0: So the one teacher, who is... and not in a very formal way like his teacher, in a less formal way. So that's been amazing. So the feedback that I get from his two tutors that he has... And we haven't been doing it for a long time, maybe a month or so, maybe over a month, has been been great. Overall very positive. So I'm very happy because he did need help in ELA and math and was complete lack of participation in his Google Classroom. I didn't even know what he knew and what he learned any more this past year. So the one on one ability without having to go anywhere, get dressed, drive, so that was a great deal and I hope that will stay. And I hope it will stay because, why not? There's a demand and there's a supply, I think that would be one good takeaway, some remote learning options.Parent 2.0: The only thing I probably would miss about using technology is the communication with the schools and the teachers. It was easier to communicate–Parent 2.0: Yes, having direct contact with the teachers and the schools ,instead of the school sending a bunch of print outs with the children in folders, that became overwhelming, all the paper. The teachers, they were able to reach out to me immediately. I mean, not that they weren't doing that before, but I think it became easier to do because it just became that platform that everyone was using. I believe my school, they use Class Dojo as a way to communicate. I think the platform that they used for the students in the school work was iLearn and I didn't really like it so I'm kind of glad...Parent 2.0: I mean, now that they're going to school five days a week they don't need to use that.

       "0  Moderator: So just starting to think through some of the impact of technology, can we talk a little bit about how your child used technology prior to the pandemic for school purposes?Parent 2.0: Oh okay. Well, they didn't use it as much. I mean, the teachers would assign some reading or math assignments on I ready and from time to time some homework. But yeah, that was about it. I would monitor how much time they were on Roblox and other things to entertain themselves, but it was easier control them back then because they didn't have to go on as much. I mean, that's what it was.Parent 3.0: I would say the same thing. My daughter was in fifth grade, we would have a couple in Newsela projects, half an hour of homework. But we were in the playground, neighborhood friends, after school projects, after school swimming. A little bit of tablet on the weekends, but there was no internet access and there was no YouTube in my life, there was no Roblox, there was no gaming. So, a very different world.Parent 5.0: I have a similar experience to Parent 3. My high schooler had a lot of his homework that he had to type and word process... I don't know if that's the right word, into Docs, but it wasn't a huge amount. It wasn't doing research, it wasn't hours and hours. My elementary school guy, he didn't have any homework on the computer at all. And my middle schooler had very little, like type this one thing or something like that. It was very little on the computer. And for myself, in terms of my family, I lock the video games so that there was very little access to video games during the week.Parent 5.0: And then on the weekends there was an hour or something like that, it wasn't that much. There was no YouTube watching, like now YouTube consumes our life. My kids didn't even know how to use the features on our TV, the smart features, they didn't know they could access YouTube on it or anything like that. So it was very controlled and very little. I also had my children in a lot of afterschool activities. My older son was in an orchestra, he also was in a band, theater groups, there was a lot of afterschool activity. A lot of playing outside, a lot of going to the park and all that stuff. Yeah, so...Parent 4.0: I can go. My kids probably had more... It sounds like they did more online than, so far, the rest of them. But my daughter in high school definitely had almost all of her homework... Not all of it because she was assigned in school, but she definitely was on doing homework, I feel like, a good amount. Nothing like now, but definitely was using it. My middle schooler also, but not as much. They both did play games or use Instagram, my daughter was really into Instagram, not as much anymore but definitely games. Now it's just like a free-for-all. I mean, they're in their rooms with the door shut, I have no idea what they're doing all day. I just know that they're doing their homework, getting good grades. I think they're on electronics the entire day.Parent 1.0: Yeah, so I have a similar experience with my eight-year-old. Pre-pandemic he was still in second grade so the use of computers was very limited. Maybe once a week he would type, words of the week was one of the options I picked to do. That was his only interaction with computer. Of course he had devices to play on, and he would go to his father's house every other weekend and he would be more exposed there to computers. But still he was busy. He was busy during the week, there was school, there was getting to school, getting from school, that's a trip in itself.Parent 1.0: There was hockey, we had TaeKwonDo, he was very busy. Even then it didn't seem like enough, it didn't seem like we were doing enough but he was certainly a lot busier than now.

He was typing away, quickly was able to navigate where to go to sign into a Google classroom. So, that was impressive in the beginning, how quickly they were able to adapt to that. So yes... I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?   \n",
       "2  Moderator: How the technology has changed during the pandemic, school purposes and whether it's beneficial or problematic?Parent 1.0: Right, exactly, it seems beneficial because it is an important part of your life as you grow older in high school clearly, and in middle school as Parent 4 said, there's some use of computer. So at first it seemed like a good thing, and I'm sure it is a good thing, it's just, like I said, it's just become overwhelming use of technology because they sit in front of it all day. And another thing, this use of YouTube, because I understand teachers post some things that you can look up on YouTube, so you can't block YouTube because it'll be used as a tool for one of those classes they have.Parent 1.0: But YouTube is just this bottomless hole of... I can't even begin, it's just so bad. And transition from looking at your Google classroom or your Google meet and here's YouTube, it's just so easy. And we were not always there, we still have jobs and other things to do, can't just sit on top of them. So this accessibility of technology that has this type of content, like YouTube, that's not beneficial for kids, that's been problematic, to say the least.Parent 5.0: So for us, we only had a desktop and a laptop, which was more than sufficient pre-pandemic. And then everybody needed a device, all of a sudden everybody needed a device Needed to be on at basically the same times so we got one device from school, we bought a laptop, we found an old laptop. It was like the gathering of devices. And then teaching... My nine-year-old, teaching him how to use it, he really hadn't used computers in that way. And so teaching him how to use it. My middle son is prone to migraines and so being on the screen caused migraines and so that caused some aversion because he didn't want to be on.Parent 5.0: The schedules were kind of crazy, like all over the place. And the truth is that it's hard because my 17-year-old, who knew how to do all these things just kind of stayed in his room for months. And it was just... I feel bad saying it, but he was kind of left to his own devices. He wasn't a big social media guy, he has no social media still, but when the only way to communicate with his peers became to use... What is it? Discord, and all these other things, that became the only way to communicate with people. And then it almost, I feel like... Like Parent 1 said, it's like this black hole that sucks you in.Parent 5.0: And then there was also no schedule. Because we have some special needs in our family, my schedule is really tight with my kids and so the little guys we go to bed at 8:30 and then 9:00 and then the older one was in bed by 10:00 and there was a lot of structure, and literally it was like a bomb hit it. People were going to bed at 1:00 in the morning, it was just totally... It felt chaotic and out of control, and it felt like the technology sputtered for a little bit as we gt devices figured out how to get everybody on and then it was this black hole that sucked you in. And then everybody was on for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours, and it felt out of control.Parent 3.0: Sure, when lock down happened my then first grader, the school did a great job pivoting to remote quite quickly. They used seesaw as a platform. I did get two laptops from the DOE because we have a lot of tech but it's all very old and kind of fragile and I'm like, they're going to wreck it all. Nothings insured. We're self-employed and I could just see the whole business being wiped out so we did take a DOE iPads which was a lifesaver. But also, again, we got to one point where the computer teacher did that YouTube... We were not on the YouTube and she sent one link and they figured out, \"Oh, I can get to YouTube from this link.\"Parent 3.0: And then it was like a bomb went off, they figured it out, they figured out workarounds and it was like Pandora's box. I was trying to figure out how to block... I was on the phone with t...   \n",
       "3  Moderator: Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?Parent 4.0: Absolutely. If you want, I can finish that. Actually I'm having problems now because my sons school said... We requested, they didn't say it, but depending on the size of the class you might be able to go in one more day. You can only go one day a week now. And I was able to get him in two days. And the fit that I got, screaming at me for five days until that day came, it was horrible. About how [inaudible 00:33:53] the worst, making him go in for two days instead of just one, so I can only imagine what's going to happen next year.Parent 2.0: I'm sorry. My sons, they actually go to school five days out of the week. Initially we were blended and I had the same issues, the same issues with just constantly on YouTube, and constantly playing Roblox. When they were supposed to do their work I would go in and I would see them clicking out of the YouTube window. We received two laptops from the DOE as well, but before it was kind of limited because we had a desktop and we had a laptop. So before they had to take turns going on the computer if they were allowed to. They went on the computer but it was mainly on the weekends because they did play Roblox but not as often.Parent 2.0: But after everything shut down I didn't have much entertainment to do besides television or talking with your friends or Roblox or Discord or whatever. Yeah, it just consumed a lot of their time. My daughter, who is three, I couldn't send her to the babysitter anymore, so she was home with me while I was working from home so I would have to force her to look at YouTube too, or watch the television. So I kind of really felt bad because I had to do that so I try to always turn on something educational, like Sesame Street. But then she started telling me what she wanted to watch after a while, Nick Jr. or Netflix, so that became a problem.Parent 2.0: But even after my son started going back to school five days out of the week it still became a problem, technology, because right after they do their homework they will go on YouTube or they go on Roblox or something. I don't know what they're doing in the back. I have to tell them to go in the back because when they come home from school I still have to work so it still became a problem even though they're back in school five days out of the week. So yeah, and they still have some assignments on the computer, like homework assignments on the computer. Yeah, even if they go back to school I feel like it still would be a problem if you're having issues now with them remotely. So yeah, that's my experience.Parent 5.0: For me, the months that I tried to work from home with my three kids was nearly impossible, like I'm sure many other people. So out of desperation, in September we decided to put my middle schooler in a private school, so he has been going five days a week with some interruptions when they close school, but there hasn't been that many. Today, I guess I got word from the elementary school that they're moving to a five day week model, I guess in two weeks. But my son has been going for two days a week since October with the school closings and stuff. But he is happy to go. He's looking forward to go. And my high schooler has also been going blended, it's interesting because sometimes...Parent 5.0: Yes, I am. This is exactly what happened all throughout the pandemic.Parent 5.0: And my high schooler, I think it's interesting because even if he's the only one, which has happened several times, he goes when he supposed to go. I was like, \"You're going to keep going?\" And he's like, \"Yeah, I'm going to go.\" And I'm like, \"Okay.\" So I personally don't anticipate any issues. He's graduating, I think that's also part of it, because I think they missed out on their whole senior year and everything that they were looking forward to so just being able to go and see teachers and stuff like that,...   \n",
       "4  Moderator: Any positive parts you would like to see continue, or are there parts that you're really hoping would end as we go back?Parent 3.0: The Google Classrooms, since my daughter has very little executive functioning, she has social anxiety and ADHD, just being able to use the chat function since she'll never raise her hand and she'll never ask for help. Using Google Classroom to directly reach out to the teacher and use the chat function has been fantastic. And then when she goes in blended she has more direct contact with the teacher. She goes in twice or three times a week with her cohort. So I like the Google Classroom set up for her as a sixth grader. Also, the smaller cohorts have been great. It's going to be, just to answer the other question, odd when it goes back to 32 kids. But I love that she can send a quick message, she gets a quick response back, and so that communication has really helped her a lot as an introvert and having those issues.Parent 4.0: Yeah, same thing with Google Classroom. It's probably recent, in the past month or two maybe, that we get a daily update at the end of the day for my middle schooler. I at least see what he's doing, which is probably more than what I ever got from him or the school, definitely from the school, before. So, that's nice to at least get a daily rundown of... It might only be a sentence or two each, but it's at least Something. So, that's nice. And I also like that they do get immediate responses basically from teachers if they have questions on homework or questions... Whatever it might be, but everyone is pretty receptive to responding in a quick time period.Parent 1.0: So my son, Google Classroom, it was not a good experience because he would not put his camera on, he would just hide behind his camera. He would not participate. He did not reach out in the G chat message or whatever. So that part has not been working out for us very well. However, someone had an idea that I overheard, and so I found a tutor, just another teacher from another school who does tutoring. And so the ability to have tutoring at your fingertips without having to commute or travel, or go and wait and sit there in the car has been... And not just that, but the ability to one on one connects like this.Parent 1.0: So the one teacher, who is... and not in a very formal way like his teacher, in a less formal way. So that's been amazing. So the feedback that I get from his two tutors that he has... And we haven't been doing it for a long time, maybe a month or so, maybe over a month, has been been great. Overall very positive. So I'm very happy because he did need help in ELA and math and was complete lack of participation in his Google Classroom. I didn't even know what he knew and what he learned any more this past year. So the one on one ability without having to go anywhere, get dressed, drive, so that was a great deal and I hope that will stay. And I hope it will stay because, why not? There's a demand and there's a supply, I think that would be one good takeaway, some remote learning options.Parent 2.0: The only thing I probably would miss about using technology is the communication with the schools and the teachers. It was easier to communicate–Parent 2.0: Yes, having direct contact with the teachers and the schools ,instead of the school sending a bunch of print outs with the children in folders, that became overwhelming, all the paper. The teachers, they were able to reach out to me immediately. I mean, not that they weren't doing that before, but I think it became easier to do because it just became that platform that everyone was using. I believe my school, they use Class Dojo as a way to communicate. I think the platform that they used for the students in the school work was iLearn and I didn't really like it so I'm kind of glad...Parent 2.0: I mean, now that they're going to school five days a week they don't need to use that. I think only the children who are remote use it, but...   \n",

I don't know if that's the right word, into Docs, but it wasn't a huge amount. But my daughter in high school definitely had almost all of her homework... Not all of it because she was assigned in school, but she definitely was on doing homework, I feel like, a good amount. Nothing like now, but definitely was using it. I think they're on electronics the entire day. Pre-pandemic he was still in second grade so the use of computers was very limited. That was his only interaction with computer. There was hockey, we had TaeKwonDo, he was very busy. So I don't know how he had time, but he did play, not a lot.  \n",

       "2                                                                                                                             How the technology has changed during the pandemic, school purposes and whether it's beneficial or problematic?Parent 1.0: And we were not always there, we still have jobs and other things to do, can't just sit on top of them. And then teaching... My nine-year-old, teaching him how to use it, he really hadn't used computers in that way. He wasn't a big social media guy, he has no social media still, but when the only way to communicate with his peers became to use... What is it? I did get two laptops from the DOE because we have a lot of tech but it's all very old and kind of fragile and I'm like, they're going to wreck it all. I finally figured out my son, by banging on it so much he's actually broken the screen so whatever controls I put in, he could bang on it and it would just do whatever he wanted. A month later I exchange the iPad but I nearly ripped my own hair out over this YouTube. Like I said, both my kids are on it all day. And I'm like, I don't understand, it's a school day.  \n",
       "3  Do any of you think that you'll have challenges with your children returning to school full-time?Parent 4.0: But after everything shut down I didn't have much entertainment to do besides television or talking with your friends or Roblox or Discord or whatever. I don't know what they're doing in the back. So out of desperation, in September we decided to put my middle schooler in a private school, so he has been going five days a week with some interruptions when they close school, but there hasn't been that many. Today, I guess I got word from the elementary school that they're moving to a five day week model, I guess in two weeks. So with my kids, they have bought into going back to school. My son has been on a 2-3 day week model since January. Before that it was 1-2 days a week I think. It was always just like, he's that kid, type of thing. So I think this is actually one of the silver linings for me with the pandemic, is kids that have issues, sort of like some of our children, when there's a big class size and one teacher and all that, they may not have a good experience I may not want to go back there.  \n",
       "4                                    Any positive parts you would like to see continue, or are there parts that you're really hoping would end as we go back?Parent 3.0: Using Google Classroom to directly reach out to the teacher and use the chat function has been fantastic. He did not reach out in the G chat message or whatever. And so the ability to have tutoring at your fingertips without having to commute or travel, or go and wait and sit there in the car has been... And not just that, but the ability to one on one connects like this. So the feedback that I get from his two tutors that he has... And we haven't been doing it for a long time, maybe a month or so, maybe over a month, has been been great. So the one on one ability without having to go anywhere, get dressed, drive, so that was a great deal and I hope that will stay. I mean, now that they're going to school five days a week they don't need to use that. I think only the children who are remote use it, but I didn't really like it, it wasn't intuitive and I wasn't able to view the assignments, both of their assignments to make sure that they did it.
